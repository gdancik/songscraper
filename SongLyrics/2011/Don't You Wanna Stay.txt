[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
I really hate to let this moment go
Touchin' your skin, and your hair fallin' slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson]
Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Bridge: Jason Aldean, Kelly Clarkson, Both]
Oh, yeah
Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
Yeah, you feel so perfect, baby
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Outro: Kelly Clarkson with Jason Aldean]
Don't you wanna stay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
