[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
And ev'rybody take a whiff on me
Ha-ha, baby take a whiff on me

[Verse 1]
Went up Ellum
And I comed down Main
Tried to bum a nickel
Just to buy cocaine there, an-a ho-ho
Baby, take a whiff on me

[Verse 2]
What I tell ya somethin's gonna, make your mind tickelin'
Two bars a-coke, can't find bum nickel
An-a ha-ha, baby take a whiff on me

[Verse 3]
Now, you oughta see that pitchin' ol lamb
Just trade your dollar
And he gave 'em a heifer and a hoss
Baby, take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
An e'rybody take a whiff on me
And-a ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me

[Verse 4]
When I was down to the Dallas king boss
The judge he found me a ten inch holster and a hoss
Baby, take a whiff on me

[Verse 5]
Take me down into the Dallas Jail
And they told me, boy I'll never bail there
An-a ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
An ev'rybody take a whiff on me
Ha-ha, baby take a whiff on me
(Don't finish, don't finish it)

[Verse 6]
When I'm married, gonna buy me a line
Whup a-my baby just to change her mind
And let her ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me

[Verse 7]
When I'm married, gonna buy me a rope
Give a whiff to my baby just because I love her
And a ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
Said, ev'rybody take a whiff on me
And ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me
Said, ev'rybody take a whiff on me
And ho-ho, baby take a whiff on me
