[Verse 1]
In the moonlight
Under startlite
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff

[Bridge]
I believe love will always be the same
Ways and means are the parts subject to change

[Chorus]
M-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e
It's the method of modern love

[Verse 2]
I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Times too tight to fight
And we're never face to face

[Bridge]
Style is timeless and fashion's only now
We've got the ways no one needs to show us how

[Chorus]
M-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e
It's the method of modern love

It's the modern love
[Chorus]
M-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e
It's the method of modern love
