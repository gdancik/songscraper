No one in the world
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
'Cause nowhere in the world
Could there be a girl as true as you, girl
All my love I give gladly to you
All your love you give gladly to me
Tell me why then
Oh, why should it be that

We go on hurtin' each other
We go on hurtin' each other
Makin' each other cry
Hurtin' each other
Without every knowin' why

Closer than the leaves
On a weepin' willow, baby, we are
And closer, dear, are we
Than the simple letters A and B are
All my life I could love only you
All your life you could love only me
Tell me why then
Oh, why should it be that

We go on hurtin' each other
We go on hurtin' each other
Makin' each other cry
Hurtin' each other
Without ever knowin' why

Can't we stop hurtin' each other?
Gotta stop hurtin' each other
Makin' each other cry
Breakin' each other's heart
Tearin' each other apart

Can't we stop hurtin' each other?
Gotta stop hurtin' each other
Makin' each other cry
Breakin' each other's heart
Tearin' each other apart
