[Intro]
Mama yeah! Woo!
Mama!
Ma-ma-ma-ma, yeah!

[Verse 1]
I never knew, never knew how complete love could be
Till she kissed me and said:

[Chorus]
"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold 'me close don't ever let me go"

[Verse 2]
I couldn't say what I wanted to say
Till she whispered:
"I love you so"

[Chorus]
"Please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please go all the way
Just hold me close, don't ever let me go"

[Bridge]
Before her love I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place where my heart should have been
But now I've changed and it feels so strange
I come alive when she does all those things to me
And she says:
"Come on, come on, come on
I need you, I love you, I need you"

[Chorus]
"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close don't ever let me go"

[Outro]
Oh no
Uuuh, uuh, uuhh
Oh no
No, no, no, nah, nah
Go all the way, baby
Woo-hoo-ooo!
