There was a time when I didn't know
If I would ever see a sign of real love
Until I met You I didn't know
About true happiness, about true devotion
I could have a faith, a faith to move a mountain
Without love I'd be worth nothing
I could give all my money away
But without love I would gain nothing
I know that You're the main connection
That can put me on the track
Headed in the right direction

This is the way of love
Oh, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

Love is patient, love is kind
That's the kind of love that You give me all the time
I like a love that keeps no record of wrongs
Loves me when I'm good, loves me when I'm not
I know that whether night or day
I'll be waiting for the moment just to hear You say

This is the way of love
Oh, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

This is the way of love, oh yeah
This is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

Oh, this is the way
This is the way of love
The way of love
This is the way
Ah-oh, this is the way
Of love, of love

This is the most excellent way
This is the most excellent way
This is the most excellent way of love

Love is patient, love is kind
That's the kind of love that You give me all the time
I like a love that keeps no record of wrongs
Loves me when I'm good, loves me when I'm not
I know whether night or day
I'll be waiting for the moment just to hear You say

This is the way of love
Oh, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

This is the way of love, whoa, yes
This is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
(No doubt, no doubt)
I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way, this is the way of love

I've got the notion
Love is devotion
Not just emotion

No more confusion
No more illusion
Found the solution...
