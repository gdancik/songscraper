[Verse 1]
Even when I'm at my worst
I am still of righteous birth
Covered by a saving grace
Past, present, future debt erased
My heart is changing day by day
(Day by day by day by day by day by day)

When I run like wild fire
I am still a ransomed child
Bought with blood spilt on a tree
Sin, death, they have no hold on me
My will is changing day by day
(Day by day by day by day by day by day)

[Pre-Chorus]
I am not who I was, now I am who I am
A sinner saved, a stumbling saint
Still I'm never alone, He's alive in my bones
The ghost of God sanctifies

[Chorus]
Day by day by day, day by day by day
Day by day by day

[Verse 2]
What I once desired for
Is not what I desire more
Heart of stone turned into flesh
Love, joy, peace taking over the mess
It's all I'm wanting day by day
(Day by day by day by day by day by day)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not who I was, now I am who I am
A sinner saved, a stumbling saint
Still I'm never alone, He's alive in my bones
The ghost of God sanctifies

[Chorus]
Day by day by day, day by day by day
Day by day by day
Day by day by day, day by day by day
Day by day by day

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I don't always believe that I'm even a saint
Justified with new life
But I'm never the same when I remember the gift
Of His grace builds my faith

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No, I'm not who I was, now I am who I am
A sinner saved, a stumbling saint
I'm not ever alone, He's alive in my soul
The ghost of God sanctifies

[Chorus]
Day by day by day, day by day by day
Day by day by day (day by day by day)
Day by day by day, day by day by day
Day by day by day (day by day by day)
