[Verse 1]
Why me Lord?
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you
Or the kindness you've shown?

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand

[Verse 2]
Try me, Lord
If you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord
I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand
Jesus
My soul's in your hand
