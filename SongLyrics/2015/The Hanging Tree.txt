[Verse 1]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 2]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 3]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 4]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of hope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 3]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 1]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 2]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
