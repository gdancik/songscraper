[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh

[Verse: Rihanna]
We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
Who knows why it's gotta be this way? (Be this way, be this way)
We say nothing more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
I say "your place" when we leave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, ooh-ooh
