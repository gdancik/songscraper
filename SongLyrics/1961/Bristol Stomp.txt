The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin when they join in jumpin
When they do the Bristol Stomp
Whoa, whoa they start spinnin every Friday night
They dance the greatest and they do it right
Well, it's the latest it's the greatest sight to see
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
(Whoa, oh, oh)

When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin when they join in jumpin
(Ah-ah-ah, whoa)
When they do the Bristol Stomp
Whoa, whoa it started in Bristol at a dee jay hop
They hollered and whistled never wanted to stop
We pony and twisted and we rocked with Daddy G
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)

Really somethin when they join in jumpin
(Ah-ah-ah)
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Duh-duh-doo)
It's got that groovy beat
That makes you stomp your feet
Come along and try
Gonna feel fine
And once you dance with me
You'll fall in love you see

The Bristol Stomp will make you mine
All mine
The stars are spinnin every Friday night
They dance the greatest if they do it right
But it's the latest it's the greatest sight to see
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin when they join in jumpin
When they do the Bristol Stomp

It started in Bristol at a dee jay hop
They hollered and whistled
Never wanted to stop
We pony and twisted
And we rocked with Daddy G
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp

(Whoa)
Really somethin when they join in jumpin
(Ah-ah-ah)
When they do the Bristol Stomp
Feel so fine
Oh, got to say, please, mine
I'm talkin (when they do the Bristol Stomp)
Mine baby (kids in Bristol...)
