I Pray (unplugged)
Chorus
Say me a sit down pon a rock just a cool and relax
With the blue blue sky and the green green grass
Burn fe me herb please do not disturb
Ca me wan hear the sound of the two sweet bird
I wan find the way home
Where the sun shine and the animal roam
Where the sea flow and the wind get blown
Where me hair long right down to the ground
Where no one fuss and no one can moan
Where no one throw not a stick or a stone
Where no man rule and no man get crown
Just the almighty i sit down pon the throne
Main chorus
I pray fe a land that free of evil - i pray
I pray that the wicked them read jah bible - i pray
While me a sit down pon a rock just a cool and relax
With the blue blue sky and the green green grass
Burn fe me herb - please do not disturb
Ca me wan hear the sound of the two sweet bird
I wan to start understand
Why the whole world ina confusion
Why man a fight gainst fe him brother man
Why the children have fe suffer so long
Why do we watch this ya destruction
When we done know that the solution
Is fe live good and respect everyone
No matter what them colour creed or nation
Main chorus
I pray fe the sick them and the needy - i pray
I pray that a man no need fe greedy - i pray
I pray that we can live in unity - i pray
I pray that we can live as one family - i pray
