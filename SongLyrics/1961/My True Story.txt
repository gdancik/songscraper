Cry, cry, cry whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Cry, cry, cry whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh

There is a story, yeah
That I must tell of two lovers
That I bewail

Now they must cry, cry, cry, whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Their blues away
(Cry, cry, cry, their blues away)

Her name was Sue, yeah
His name was Earl
His love was Lorraine

She's a wonderful girl
But they must cry, cry, cry, whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Their blues away
(Their blues away)

Love will make you happy
And love will make you cry
Love will make the tears fall

When your lover says goodbye
And then you'll cry, cry, cry, whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your blues away
(Cry, cry, cry, their blues away)

This story ends, yeah
It was no lie
Names have been changed dear
To protect you and I

But we must cry, cry, cry, whoa, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Our blues away
(Cry, cry, cry)

Mm
(Whoa, uh our blues away)
We must cry
(Cry, cry, cry, whoa, uh our blues away)
