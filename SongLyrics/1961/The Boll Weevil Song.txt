Let me tell ya a story about a boll weevil
Now, some of you may not know, but a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now, where he comes from, hmm, nobody really knows
But this is the way the story goes

The farmer said to the boll weevil "I see you're on the square"
Boll weevil said to the farmer "Say yep! My whole darn family's here"
(We gotta have a home, gotta have a home)

The farmer said to the boll weevil "Say, why do you pick my farm?"
The weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said
"We ain't gonna do ya much harm"
("We're looking for a home")

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug
He said "Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
But, ya see if I was a lightning bug, I'd search the whole night through"
("Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home")

And the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said
"Ya better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh
You can't even buy gasoline."
(I'm gonna stake me a home, gotta have a home)

And the boll weevil said to the farmer, said
"Farmer, I'd like to wish you well."
Farmer said to the boll weevil, "Yeah, an' I wish that you were in shit"
(Lookin' for a home, lookin' for a home)
(Ahh, you have a home all right, you have a home)
(A real hot home, ahh)
