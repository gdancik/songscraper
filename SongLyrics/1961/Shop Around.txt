[Intro]
When I became of age, my mother called me to her side
She said, "Son you're growing up now
Pretty soon you'll take a bride"
And then she said

[Verse 1]
Just because you've become a young man now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now

[Chorus]
My mama told me, you better shop around
Oh yeah, you better shop around

[Verse 2]
Oh, there's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Try to get yourself a bargain, son
Don't be sold on the very first one
Pretty girls come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

[Verse 3]
Before you take a girl and say, "I do" now
Make sure that her love is true now

[Chorus]

[Saxophone solo]

[Bridge]

[Verse 4]
Before you take a girl and say, "I do" now
Make sure she's in love with you now
Make sure that her love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh don't let the first one get you
Oh no cause I don't wanna see her with you
Oh before you let her hold you tight
Oh make sure she's alright
Oh before you let 'em take your hand my son
Understand my son, be a man my son
I know you can my son, I love you
