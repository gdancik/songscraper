[Intro]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
I'd keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah
I might miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
I'd keep away from a Runaround Sue

[Pre-Refrain]
She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys

[Refrain]
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from a Runaround Sue

[Bridge]
Yeah, keep away from this girl
I know, know what she'll do
Keep away from Sue

[Pre-Refrain]
She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys

[Refrain]
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah

[Outro]
Stay away from that girl
Don't you know what to do now
Keep away from that girl
Don't you know what to do now
