They drove me to the other side
Off the airport, it's dead or alive
As light dribbles down
The invisible outside
The mist around the plane
I guess once they take me from here
I'll never return again
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
It's the child in his eyes
Always makes me cry
And I said to myself
I will rise to the highest high
(Never say die)
It's so easy to see the glory
But there are many sides to the story
And we're all staying a lie
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
They drove me to the other side
Just in time, for high tide
Everything in life is a state of mind
So I'll cancel the future if only the strong survive
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
Everything in life is a state of mind
So I'll cancel the future if only the strong survive
What have I done?
What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time...
