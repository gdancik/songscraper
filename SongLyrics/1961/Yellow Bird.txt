Yellow bird, yellow bird
I'd fly away with you but I am not a yellow bird
You're more lucky than me
I also had a pretty girl, she's not with me today
Take tenderness, then they fly away
They're all the same, those pretty girls
You can fly away, in the sky away
You're more lucky than me
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
You can fly away, in the sky away
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
So here I sit, nothing I can do
Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
Wish that I were a yellow bird
