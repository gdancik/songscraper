Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
A smiling face
A warm embrace
Two arms to hold me tenderly

Where the boys are
My true love will be
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me

In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine

Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me

Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
