Missin you
Can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight
Making love to me
Kissin you kissin you
Thats all I want to do
It never seems just right
Now that we are apart it for you to write
Saying you love me too
Missin you
Can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight
Log on to Top40db
Making love to me
I always spend my time
Just writing lines to you
Can't wait for you to write
Sayin you love me too
Missin you
Can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight
Making love to me
