[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy I know you watchin' me
So what's it gonna to be
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy you got me inspired
Baby come and get it
If you're really feelin’ me

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause it's my night
No stress no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby come and get it
Let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain’t gonna let nobody's drama bother me

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause it's my night (my night)
No stress no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears no time to cry
(No tears)
Just making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
('Cause it's)
'Cause it's my night
(It's my, it's my night)
No stress no fights
(No stress, I'm leaving it all behind)
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears no time to cry
(No tears)
Baby I'm making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jermaine Dupri]
Everybody is livin' it up
(I said everybody)
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
(Looking at us on the floor like what)
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what

While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all that y'all
