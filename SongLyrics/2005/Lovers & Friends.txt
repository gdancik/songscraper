[Verse 2: PNV Jay]
You know what going on PNV
He did him all in the ribs when I asked your girl I'ma pass her off
Blow through a hit with no mask on
Make a Kobe going to hope out the back door
Designer, we blow a whole bag on it
Imma get it, don't have to ask for it
Soon as we hit up the spot, we throwing a bands, she shaking her ass for it
Dripping in water, Dasani
Then we get me a rob with the Tommy
True designer it's all on my body
Heard you were looking for me, you can come find me
She all on me as soon as I meet her
Going up or I'm breaking the meter
I’ma hit it one time, I don’t keep it
Free because they got me down for (?)
Heavy dripping they see what I'm on
Steady coming strong, I’m doing it calm
I'm a get it put that on my mom
PNV and Fetty we dropping a bomb
I'm a king, you niggas is pawns
Ball on niggas, I feel like Lebron
Get the bag you should know what we on
As soon as she hear it she singing my song
Treesh

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Look what I do
They say it ain't true
Hundreds are blue

Look what I do for you baby
They say it ain’t true (Ooh, ah)
The hundreds are blue baby, Yeah
