[Verse 1]
Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

[Chorus 1]
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

[Verse 2]
Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

[Chorus 2]
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3 with repeats]
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
(Anticipating)
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
(Anticipating)
Someday I'll be over you
As soon as my heart
(As soon as my heart stops breakin')
(Anticipating)

[Guitar solo until fade-out]
