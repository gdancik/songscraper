[Verse 1]
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

[Verse 2]
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Wah!

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Venus

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

[Verse 1]
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Wah!

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Venus was her name

Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
