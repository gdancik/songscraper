[Verse 1]
Hey, here is the story
Forget about the trouble in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line

[Chorus]
That's why - You need
That's why - This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

[Verse 2]
Don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from
What you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Just pick it up and throw it into shape

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey you, won't you listen
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm
I'll take you where you
Really need to be
