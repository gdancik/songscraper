[Intro: Eminem]
Uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been to many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and {five I hit (Whoops!)}
{Aw shit,} I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb {shit} start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
I said come on bounce!
Everybody in the house doin' mass {amounts (Me!)}
To the women in the thongs with their asses out (Oh)
We don't bull{shit}, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is {crashin' out}
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out (Come on)

[Verse 2: Kuniva, Kon Artis (& Eminem)]
Bump that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestlin' with Elton John
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
They gotta be {Tums, the Ex-Lax} is gone
Yeah, I took 'em {all, dawg,} with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of {cum}
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so {high}
That you might wake up with a {guy} on some new {shit}
Yeah, I think I {did} too much (Huh-uh)
I think I got the runs (Huh-uh)
{Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums}
Watch out, here it comes! (Ha-ha-ha!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been to many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Bridge: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some, some, some
Somethin'... I don't know

[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]
Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills, on stilts I walk
{Snort two lines} that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and {killed} the Hulk
I wanna {roll} away like a rollerblade
Until my {eyes roll} back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray, yo, I'ma go for broke?
No? Okey-doke, {I'm packin' my nose} with soap
(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a {whore} lady
Now I'm payin' child support? (It's your baby!)

[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]
I take {four shots} at one time
And I don't need to chase when I'm swallowin' mine (Hey, you got any room?)
In Bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far, 'cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it so (Swift, chill!)
I'm just tryna get by like you
And I don't give a damn if you find me rude (Huh-uh)
Mean, crude, to hell with you too (Huh-uh)
I only need three {blunts} and I'm cool
I just got some and I'm goin' back soon

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been to many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave, lookin' at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy
Dopey-headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses
Wanna try? (Go on)
{Blue hills, golden seals}
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill — {Yeah, right!}
Chick, I'm for real!
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been to many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Bridge: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
