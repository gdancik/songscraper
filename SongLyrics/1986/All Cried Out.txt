[Verse 1]
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you...

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

[Chorus]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you (Oh, you, all over you, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me
To find my way home? How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Chorus]
Oh...
I gave you all of me (Gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all)
Over you (I'm cried out, too)

[Chorus]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
(I left you so confused
Now I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out
Over you
