Lyrical Miracle by Jon Mantooth Jd_the_Man-T

I'll take you on a trip
I won't give you anything
Not a sip
I'll take you on a trip with words
They can cut deeper then swords
They can even change the world
Pay me how every much you feel
Your time is worth
I'm above money
I'm doing good on this earth
I'm comfortable
Are you comfortable?
If not life's is completely adjustable
Pink Floyd, said it best
"Look around, choose your own ground"
Do you need a lighter?
I'll make your life brighter
Age is nothing but a number
You should count the rings inside the lumber
It's not about ones self wealth
It's more important to care about your health
How old are you in here? (Point to brain)
Please try not to go insane
I need to be clear here
I bet your a few thousand years old
But never fear
Not trying to be religious
Or even prestigious
Im just trying to find the truth in all of us
These are things we need to discuss
Remember you can leave any time you want
But you should listen to these words i flaunt
To display proudly
Arn't you proud of me
See i'm a prophet too of sorts
People can add to their own bible in their own house
Of course
To your core beliefs
Life's hard in these streets
It's more of a reference
Something to guide you
You can think deep inside too
You see, open your eyes and heart deep
What do you see when you sleep
Tick, tick, real quick
You see this is your time not mine
I'm here to guide you on your way
Everything is going to be ok
Your brain remembers better when words rhyme
You know I'm writing my own book
With my own lines
In these crying times
You have actually been reading it this entire time
Because this is how it starts

Remember, numbers are a human invention


We can play with them
They can be our friend
"You say you need an eraser
I say you should find a new paper"
Im sure someone wrote that down sometime
In order to get remembered in time
But remember
Time is nothing
Its no thing
Another human invention
You can play with it
Move it around
Remember the day you were found
It was your birthday
It was your first day
I bet you don't even remember
What you were talking about last September
Or November, December
Remember those rhymes
Another human invention
So you can remember those lines
You can play with it
Its all to get you to remember anyway
Refer to the last couple pages
If you need to any day
I need to check the time again
Because for some reason
Its matters every now and then
Because you got people to see
Places to be
Not trying to be mean
But don't tell me you know things
Unless you really know these things
That you are talking about
What are you really about
Before you  decide to preach and really teach
You should take a long walk on a beach
Find your own treasures
Just look around
You see they're everywhere
Just laying on the ground
Because they don't care
They don't have a sense of being anywhere
They're older than us
Remember when we use to share
Cool ones on the bus
Then again we're probably just as old as they are
Have you ever looked into a star
You can't really see the beauty from afar
We're all the same energy
Burning a fuse in life's eternity
Then again there goes time again
Another way to determin where i lives begin
And end
I knew a guy
Who just fell off the bluff
Thank god he's still alive
He survived
Now he can wake up truely
And see whats important in life
No more drunken nights
Living the high life
He'll be looking for a wife
Someone to start a life
Go for a walk look at the trees
Look at all life's beautiful things
Feel the breeze
You can be sober or messed up
As long as you yourself knows whats up
Be smart right from the start
Don't be a part
Of the negative
Think positive
Lets go for a walk
Just for a little talk
Even if it's just a step outside
From the house in which you reside
There's a whole world out there
You better prepare to care
For no fare
Even if you think its no fair
Money is nothing
Its no thing
Something to get you things
The happiness that it brings
But it also does evil things
The dark things
Of twisted beings
But that's because there lost
And at what cost
Have they given their souls
For their beliefs and thoughts
I feel like i'm lost and sick
I need to find a way
To go on to better day
Making sure everything will be ok
Think farther than that
Think deeper about where you are at
Are you in a house? On the street?
In a city, or a country?
Your on a planet somewhere
Lost in the internet of the universes care
It's not a curse
Just think it could be worse
But don't think like that
Open up your mind
To the glory of man kind
Change your attitude
What is your latitude
Open up your mind
And find the right signs
To lead you down this road
And as this stories told
Remember you can be anywhere
You need to care!
Life is no fair!
Stop reading, if you like
Keep reading and i'll show you life

I don't care what page i'm on
What kind of drugs was Jesus really on
When he wrote his songs
Teaching about what is right and wrong
What made him see the light
In the middle of the night
Telling people how it is
How to live life
In a lot of ways he got it right
How to be safe in the night
How to love and not fight
Because you think your right
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
I think you been thinking about it for too long
I'm not a bot
I just think alot
And write it down so it's not forgot
Learn to love life!
You need to end the strife
Because it's like a knife
Cutting you deep
It just ends up in you having no sleep
A bear does think to take a drink
It can even blink
Its as much alive as you and me
To be alive you need to survive and see
You need to strive for better things
In your lives
Go out and get some wives
Someone to give you high fives
When your on those long drives
