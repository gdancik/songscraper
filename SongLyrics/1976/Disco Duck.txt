[Rick Dees:]
Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treating me right
Moving my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat

All of a sudden
I began to change
I was on the dance floor acting strange
Flapping my arms
I began to cluck
Look at me
I'm the disco duck

[Duck:]
Ah, get down mama
I've got to have me a woman
Ha ha ha ha ha

[Chorus:]
Disco, disco duck

[Disco Duck:]
Got to have me a woman

[Chorus:]
Disco, disco duck

[Duck:]
Oh, get down, mama

[Chorus:]
Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco

[Disco Duck]:
Disco

[Chorus]:
Disco

[Disco Duck]:
Disco

[Chorus:]
Disco
Disco
Disco
Disco duck

[Disco Duck]:
All right

[Chorus:]
Disco disco duck

[Disco Duck:]
Ah, get down, mama
Oh mama, shake your tail feather
Ha ha ha ha ha

[Rick Dees:]
When the music stopped
I returned to my seat
But there's no stopping a duck and his beat
So I got back up to try my luck
Why look it's the disco duck!

[Disco Duck:]
Everybody's doing the

[Chorus:]
Disco, disco duck
Disco, disco duck
Try your luck

[Disco Duck:]
Wave to me

[Chorus:]
Don't be a cluck

[Disco Duck:]
I'm so happy to be here

[Chorus:]
Disco

[Rick Dees:]
Thank you, duck

[Chorus:]
Disco

[Rick Dees:]
For getting down

[Chorus:]
Disco disco disco

[Rick Dees:]
Thank you so very much

[Chorus:]
Disco duck

[Disco Duck:]
You're welcome

[Chorus:]
Disco
Disco Duck
Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco, disco, disco
