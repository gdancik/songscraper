[Intro]
Don't know what's happened to me since I met you
Feel like I'm falling in love since I met you

[Chorus]
I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

[Verse 1]
Knew from the start
It had to be you
You got my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do
With your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven sent a sign that sent you
I'm going out of my mind since I met you

[Chorus]
I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

[Verse 2]
Whatever it is and
Whatever it's called
I know that it's you
I can't help gettin' involved
With your love
Baby, sweet baby

[Bridge]
(With your love)
(With your love)
(With your love)

[Verse 3]
Whatever you did to me
Well, you sure did it good
My heart's filled with loving
And I knew that it would
With your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what's happened to me since I met you
I feel like I'm falling in love since I met you

[Chorus]
I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

[Verse 4]
Knew from the start
It had to be you
You got my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do
With your love

[Outro]
Baby, sweet baby
Ohhh
Woo ooh woo ooh ooh
