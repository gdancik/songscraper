[Intro]
You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end

[Verse 1]
Hey woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman

[Verse 2]
Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
You found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

[Bridge]
Hey, he-he-hey
Hey, he-he-hey
Hey, he-hey

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

[Verse 3]
Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up
You made the wine, now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

[Outro]
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
