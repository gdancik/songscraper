[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a reason for the sun-shining sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that
Love light shines all around us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover

[Chorus]
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

[Verse 2]
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those
Love lights shine all around us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So, let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back

[Chorus]
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

[Chorus]
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

[Outro]
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
