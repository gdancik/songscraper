PART 1 – GOD KNOWS

[VERSE 1]
Yeah you funny but i ball bigger
Your girl with me I'm in hton with her
We in my room drinkin all this liquor
It's goin straight down right to my liver
I swear to god
I'm crossing roads yall couldn't bear to walk
As high as a loft, no talk, can't stall now fucker
I'm too gone can't fall now fucker
I'm weird I'm lame, I ball now fucker
You wish you could feel tall now fucker
Spit flames propane cook outs all summer
No name no shame, I hate y'all fuckers
Hate what we doin, hate all thesehaters out here
They blame that they can't break states out here
No faith we gon make and seal fate out here
Fuck what you know, life what we make out here
I'm no drake, I’m no hater
Just no gold chain on my neck and no paper
I went south of cross lanes to the fayette
Ain't nobody here screaming that they made it
This ain't shit boy, this a ghost town
Same friends poppin pills to feel whole now
Same friends from band that used to show off
Now same friends watch em drink and just go off
I miss the way that it felt during roll call
Same feel that I felt when you dozed off
Same girl that I let her slip away now
New girls don't care what i say now
I make em songs now, they think it their songs
I was makin culture way before the haters said no
I was changin futures ever since these fakers weed blowed
And I been stuntin like I'm Kimble on the d-low
Young mucky flowin colder degree below
Don't matter gotta act it gotta be cold
Temper shorter than the arms on fuckin Cee-Lo
I'm a monster im a monstar im fuckin Blanko
I don't really give a fuck of what you think though
Gotta admit see me stunt make it ache though
I don’t care I can see why you hate though
I make her cum all she gotta do is say so
Young mucky got the music, gotta wait doe
This that fat mucky in the Hill playin bass tho
And them geeks in the back sellin yayo
Pushin, makin movements, tryna lay low
I was tryna make ‘em see that they need life
God knows why I’m shy, I know need light
Everything always cold with no sunlight
I don’t know why I’m here, but God knows why

[HOOK 1]
These fuckers always talkin they shit
No one real, no one real as they wish
I’m so gone I could get lost in her lips
My phone die, my soul lie drowned with fish

[BRIDGE]
Ohhhh picture it we in this bitch like we had it
You pictured it, pictured it, pictured us
Oh god dammit--

PART 2 – CAMERA ROLL

[VERSE 1]
When we were little ones
And all the stars were little suns
Did you think you end here?
And find---

[HOOK]
Whole world melting, whole world going
Porch here standing watch the whole world floating
I know
There’s not a lot to room to roam

[VERSE 2]
I can think I’m dead, I can think I’m right
I can think it’s fine
Cause the sun turned red and the steet lights shine
And I see no light
You don’t see no shine in me
Cause I let you go and you were light in me
And the sparks lay low cause it’s too dark to see
Everything’s closed, I know you’re what I need
I say what i mean to say
But I didn’t want it to end this way
Her drug too violent, i know it’s fake
Room too quiet, I know I’ll fade
Oh girl, hear me now
I know you feel it now
I know I’m wrong for you
It’s been too long for you

[OUTRO]
But picture us, picture us, picture us
Like we had it
Picture us, picture us
Oh
Picture us, picture us
Like we had it
Picture us, picture us
We can do it right
We can do it right
I can't do it right
You need it right
I need you tonight
