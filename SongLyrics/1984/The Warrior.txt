Ohhh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You run, run, run away
It's your heart that you betray
Feeding on your hungry eyes
I bet you're not so civilized
Well, isn't love primitive
A wild gift that you want to give
Break out of captivity
And follow me, stereo jungle child
Love is the kill.  Your heart's still wild

Shooting at the walls of heartache
Bang bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win if you survive
The warrior.  The warrior

You talk, talk, talk to me
Your eyes touch me physically
Stay with me, we'll take the night
As passion takes another bite
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Who's the hunter, who's the game
I feel the beat call your name
I hold you close in victory
I don't want to tame your animal style
You won't be caged in the call of the wild

Shooting at the walls of heartache
Bang bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart to win if you survive
The warrior.  The warrior
I am the warrior

Shooting at the walls of heartache
(Shooting at the walls of heartache.) The warrior
I am the warrior and heart to heart you'll win
Heart to heart you'll win if you survive
The warrior.  The warrior

Shooting at the walls of heartache
Bang bang
I am the warrior
Yes, I am the warrior and victory is mine
(Shooting at the walls of heartache.) The warrior
I am the warrior
Shooting at the walls of heartache
