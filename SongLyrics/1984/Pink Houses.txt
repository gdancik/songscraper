[Verse 1]
There's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an Interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks that he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin'
I can remember when you could stop a clock."

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby?
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah?
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh, yeah, for you and me

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rock 'n' roll station
He's got greasy hair, greasy smile
He says, "Lord, this must be my destination"
Cause they told me when I was younger
Sayin', "boy, you're gonna be president."
But just like everything else, those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby?
Ain't that America home of the free?
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh, baby, for you and me

[Verse 3]
Well, there's people and more people
What do they know, know, know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
Ooh, yeah
And there's winners, and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
Cause the simple man baby pays for the thrills, the bills
The pills that kill

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby?
Ain't that America, home of the free, yeah?
Little pink houses for you and me
Ooh

Ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby?
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me
