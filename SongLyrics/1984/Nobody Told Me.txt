[Intro]
...Three, Four!

[Verse 1]
Everybody's talking
And no-one says a word
Everybody's making love
And no-one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom
Just below the stairs
Always something happening
And nothing going on
Always something cooking
And nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China
So finish what you've got

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these[x3]
Strange days indeed[x2]

Everybody's running
And no-one makes a move
Everyone's a winner
And nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol
To the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying
And no-one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying
And no-one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies
You've just got to lay around

[Chorus]

Most peculiar mama

[Verse 2]
Everybody's smoking
And no-ones getting high
Everybody's flying
And never touch the sky
There's a U.F.O. over New York
And I ain't too surprised

[Chorus]

Most peculiar mama
