[Chorus]
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

[Verse 1]
So you think I got an evil mind
I tell you, honey
I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
It makes me money
I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

[Chorus]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

[Verse 2]
So you say I got a funny face
I got no worries
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Oh I gotta sing, it's some disgrace
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild, baby
Come on!

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, you think we have a lazy time
You should know better
I don't know why
I don't know why
So you say I got a dirty mind
I'm a mean go-getter
I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Oh, wild

Come on! (Come on!)
Feel it!
Come on!
(Girls, rock your boys)
Work it!
We'll get wild, wild, wild
(We're gonna get wild)
Wild, wild, wild
(We're gonna get wild tonight)
Come on, feel the noise
(Rock it tonight)
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
(Oh, yeah)

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah (Whoo!)
Ah, ah, ah

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah
