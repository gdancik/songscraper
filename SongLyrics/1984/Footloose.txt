[Verse 1]
Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

[Refrain]
So now I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

[Verse 2]
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You'll get by if you'd only

[Refrain]
Cut loose
Footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Ooh-wee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Woah, Milo
Come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Yeah, ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Yeah, ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh
You've got to turn me around
And put your feet on the ground
Gotta take the hold of all
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhh
I'm turning it loose

[Refrain]
Footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
(Footloose)

[Outro]
Footloose
(Footloose)
Kick off the Sunday shoes (C'mon girl)
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
(Everybody)
Everybody cut footloose!
