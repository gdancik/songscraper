(Hook)
I just stole your girl now they calling me her robber Nah...
Feeling like a plug in, I just want to call her Yah...
I be in the field yeah, like I'm playing soccer Yah...
Sipping Pink Floyd, now I feel just a rocker yah...

[Verse]
I just stole your girl now they calling me a robber
Oh I think she like me
She gon get that top off
Girlfriend call me papa
I got no daughter
Now you wanna fight me
You don't want no papa
Come in my fourty and I'm sure you get your top off
If it ain't about the money then I do not want to talk bro
I be grown and shit so
I don't wear no joggers
I be with that thinking
Like I am a monster
I be wearing all black
Shorty Im a monster
I fed her ass and blue pill
Now I am a doctor
Call me Lil Uzi (?)
Now my money longer
I do wear what (?) I want now my money longer

[Chorus]
I just stole your girl now they calling me her robber Nah...
Feeling like a plug in, I just want to call her Yah...
I be in the field yeah, like I'm playing soccer Yah...
Sipping Pink Floyd, now I feel just like rocker Yah...
