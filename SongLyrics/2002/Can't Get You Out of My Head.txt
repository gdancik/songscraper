[Intro]
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

[Verse]
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

[Verse]
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every night, every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay? Won't you lay?
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

[Verse]
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free, feel the need in me
Set me free
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

[Outro]
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
