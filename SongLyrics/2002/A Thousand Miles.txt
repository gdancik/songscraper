[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

[Chorus]
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

[Verse 2]
It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

[Chorus]
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

[Bridge]
I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

[Verse 1 (Reprise)]
Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I still need you
I still miss you
And now I wonder

[Chorus]
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you
Tonight
