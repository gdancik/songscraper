[Sample]
It's about to storm, we're actually under a tornado watch

[Chorus: Kill Bill]
How you wanna walk?
How you wanna breathe?
How you gonna talk like a G?
How you gonna r-r-rock with my steez
Been about it
Y'all just caught up in a fantasy
It's just an RPG

[Verse 1: Kill Bill]
I give a fuck about my hit points, smokin' on a thick joint
Fuckin' around, I got the juice, what it do?
Build your stats up for the beast, I got wax up in the crease
Fuckin' around, I chunk a deuce, don't fuck wit you, what it do? Uh
Hoe, I'm the last boss waiting 'til our paths cross
Fuckin' around, I got the potion, slowin' motion
Bring it up, put it down, rollercoastin', holy-ghostin' shit
Inside your head where all that goddamn commotion sits, yeah

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Kill Bill]
I do just what I gotta do
I had to cut some folks out, I mean a lot of you
You say you ride with me, who you think you're talkin' to?
That don't vibe with me, I ain't tryin' to talk with you
You know me, homie, squad over everybody
My girl trippin', always wishin' for a better body
The grass green, baby, come on, let me get inside it
I'm a fiend, baby girl, you know I've been about it, uh

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Rav]
I give a fuck about my hit points, tokin' on a thick joint
Killin' shit in Chrono Trigger, listening to Pink Floyd
All these people up in here and yet I feel a big void
Trees suppress my memories, shouts out to Sig Freud
And shout outs to Big Boi, that's the state that I am in
Switch my potions up, so I no longer take no Vicodin
No religious bitches in my circle, like Leviathan
See, you being a born again just means that you can die again, so

[Chorus x2]
