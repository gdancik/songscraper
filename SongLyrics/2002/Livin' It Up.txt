[HERMES]
And on the road to hell, there was a lot of waiting

[COMPANY]
Mmm...
Waiting

[HERMES]
Everybody waiting on a train

[COMPANY]
Mmm...
Waiting on a lady with a

[HERMES]
Waiting on a train to bring that lady

[COMPANY]
Mmm...
Lady

[HERMES]
With the suitcase back again
She's never early, always late

[COMPANY]
Waiting

[HERMES]
These days she never stays for long
But good things come to those who wait

Here she comes!

[PERSEPHONE]
Well it's like he said, I'm an outdoor girl

[HERMES]
And you're late again

[PERSEPHONE]
Married to the king of the underworld

[HERMES]
She forgot a little thing called spring

[PERSEPHONE]
Are you wondering where I've been?

[WORKER]
Where you been?

[WORKER]
I'm wondering

[PERSEPHONE]
Been to hell, and back again
But like my mama always said:
Brother when you're down, you're down
When you're up, you're up
If you ain't six feet underground, you're living it up on top
Let's not talk about hard times
Pour the wine, it's summertime!

'Cause right now we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
How are we livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it, livin' it up
Oh brother, right here we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
Where are we livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it up on top

Who makes the summer sun shine bright?
That's right, Persephone!
Who makes the fruit of the vine get ripe

[COMPANY]
Persephone!

[PERSEPHONE]
That's me
Who makes the flowers bloom again, in spite of a man?

[COMPANY]
You do!

[PERSEPHONE]
Who's doing the best she can?
Persephone, that's who

Now some might say, the weather ain't the way it used to be
But let me tell you something that my mama said to me
You take what you can get, and you make the most of it

So right now we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
How are we livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it, livin' it up
Oh brother, right here we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
Where are we livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it up on top

[HERMES, spoken]
It was summertime on the road to hell

[COMPANY]
Mmm...

[HERMES, spoken]
There was a girl who had always run away

[COMPANY]
Mmm...

[HERMES]
You might say it was in spite of herself

[COMPANY]
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm...

[HERMES]
That this young girl decided to stay
There was a poor boy with a lyre

[PERSEPHONE]
Who says times are hard?

[HERMES]
The flowers bloomed and the fruit got ripe
And brother for a moment there

[PERSEPHONE]
Anybody want a drink?

[HERMES]
The world came back to life!

[COMPANY]
Ohhhh.....

[dance break]

[PERSEPHONE]
Up on top, we ain't got much
But we're

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up

[PERSEPHONE]
Just enough to fill our cups

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top

[PERSEPHONE]
Brother pass that bottle around
'Cause we're

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[HERMES]
Let the poet bless this round

[ORPHEUS]
To the patroness of all of this, Persephone
Who has finally returned to us with wine enough to share
Asking nothing in return except that we should live
And learn to live as brothers in this life
And to trust she will provide
And if no one takes too much, there will always be enough
She will always fill our cups

[PERSEPHONE]
I will

[ORPHEUS]
And we will always raise them up
To the world we dream about, and the one we live in now

'Cause right now we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
How are we livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it up
Oh brother, right here we're livin' it

[COMPANY]
Where are we livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Listen here, I'll tell you where
We're livin' it up on top

[COMPANY]
Up on top!

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it up and we ain't gonna stop
Livin' it, livin' it

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it

[ORPHEUS]
How are we livin' it?

[COMPANY]
Where are we livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it, livin' it

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it
Livin' it up on top!
