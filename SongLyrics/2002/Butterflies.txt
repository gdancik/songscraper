Da de-de-da, da-da
(La-la-aa-ah)
Da de -de -da, da de -de-da
Da de-de-da de-de-da
(Oh I, oh I)
Da de-de de-da, lda de-da-dum
Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies, inside

[Verse 1]
All you got ta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile, when I try to say hello, to you, yeah
Ah, an' all you got ta do is not answer my calls when I'm try'n'a get through
Keep'n me wonderin' why-y-y, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(you give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I

[Verse 2]
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me, see that I can feel ya near to me
I caress you, let you taste the just so blissful, lips then
I would give you anything baby
Ah, just to make my dreams come true
Aow baby, you give me butterflies

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (you give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(you give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I

[Bridge]
If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Marsha Ambrosius]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you)(you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
