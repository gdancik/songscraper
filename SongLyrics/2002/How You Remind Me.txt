[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

[Pre-Chorus]
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet?"

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
(These five words in my head) Yeah, yeah
No, no
