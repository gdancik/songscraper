[Verse 1]
Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here
To the twilight
There's a dead end to my left
There's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you want me
Like I want you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you
Passing me by

[Verse 2]
Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down
Feel broken down

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you need me
Like I need you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

[Bridge]
A sweet sorrow is
The call tomorrow
A sweet sorrow is
The call tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love me
Like I love you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you
Passing me by
Are you passing me by?
Passing me by (do you want me)
Passing me by

[Outro]
Do you need me like I need you to
Do you want me like I want you (passing me by)
Or are you passing me by
Or am I standing still
