[Verse 1: Amy Grant]
Baby, baby
I'm taken with the notion
To love you with the sweetest of devotion
Baby, baby
My tender love will flow from
The bluest sky to the deepest ocean

[Chorus: Amy Grant]
Stop for a minute
Baby I'm so glad you're mine, yeah
You're mine

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Baby, baby
The stars are shining for you
And just like me I'm sure that they adore you
Baby, baby
Go walking through the forest
The birds above are singing you a chorus

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Stop for a minute
Baby, they're so glad you're mine, yeah
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion
Baby, I realize that there's just no getting over you

[Verse 3: Tori Kelly]
Baby, baby
In any kind of weather
I'm here for you always and forever
Baby, baby
No muscle man could sever
My love for you is true and it will never

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Stop for a minute
Baby, I'm so glad you're mine, yeah
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion
Baby, I realize that there's just no getting over you
