[Intro]
Ayy, I wanna hear this shit in all the mother fuckin' clubs, you know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna see all the bad bitches just shakin' they ass to this shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
John Gabbana
(I ain't finna tell you how Ry got away with this shit)

[Verse 1]
Jump back, hunch back, show you what that pump like
Oh, he gotta strap too? This gon' be a gun fight
This gon' be a fun night, this here boy that stunt life
Fuck it, I got one life, a pussy nigga get one strike
It ain't nothing, I know you social media niggas bluffing
You the type to hear some bubble wrap popping and get to ducking
Call my choppa big bad wolf 'cause that bitch get to huffin' puffin'
She can't sit 'round John Gabbana unless that bitch sucking, sucking
Bend over and show somethin'
Make a nigga throw somethin'
Play with me, I know somethin'
Click clack, let you hold somethin'
Checked the time and it's 4 somethin'
Grab a bottle, nigga pour somethin'
I'ma dick her down 'til I break somethin'
Come here baby, let me taste somethin'

[Chorus]
See pretty bitches in the club
But which one gon' let me fuck?
In my blicky you know I trust
Off the Remy, I feel like Russ
Nigga broke, he a sitting duck
Hollows hit like a semi truck
Take a bitch back to the bricks
Hit her with the pickle, no Rick
Couple shots in, I'm lit
Throw a lil' money, we lit
Whatever they with, we with
Bitch, let me see you jump on this dick
Gabbana make the pussy drip
Damn nigga, you pussy whipped
If he play than then that pussy killed
Better shave, I like my pussy silk

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing sweet, but I'ma star and my fucking Glock burst
Before we start exchanging names, I want some fucking top first
She wanna swallow all my kids, I call that shit the thot thirst
You fuck her raw then have a kid, I call that shit the thot curse
Timmy turn on Tina
Gomez, no Selena
Credit card fraud, no Visa
Puerto Rican bitch, my Nina
She fucked in the back of the Beamer
After she fuck, she clean up
Nigga want smoke, let's link up
Nigga not broke, let's drink up
I say let's turn up the party
'Bout time to get some shit started
I'ma tweak if I pop a molly
I feel like I'm Ricky Bobby
I like when she call me papi
This ain't a Perc, this an Oxy
I'm pimping, not talking Scotty
They say I'm goated, I'm godly
Don't wanna fuck, bitch, hit the door
Matter fact, bitch, just give me throat
Yeah I got money, but I want more
Try to rob me, get a tag on yo' toe
Nut in my bitch, I'm like oh
Diamonds be hitting, like woah
Know I gotta walk with that stick, like patrol
Don't make me take ya' soul

[Chorus]
See pretty bitches in the club
But which one gon' let me fuck?
In my blicky you know I trust
Off the Remy, I feel like Russ
Nigga broke, he a sitting duck
Hollows hit like a semi truck
Take a bitch back to the bricks
Hit her with the pickle, no Rick
Couple shots in, I'm lit
Throw a lil' money, we lit
Whatever they with, we with
Bitch, let me see you jump on this dick
Gabbana make the pussy drip
Damn nigga, you pussy whipped
If he play than then that pussy killed
Better shave, I like my pussy silk

[Outro]
John Gabbana, nigga
This the mother fuckin' thot curse
