Well every day at 6 o’clock
He gets out of bed at the crack of dawn
He puts on his jacket and steel toe boots
Gets in the car, coffee and cigarettes
And yeah we’re not wealthy but we’re men of respect
And he would say, “I think that’s more important. Don’t you?”
And I would say, “You know what Dad? I do.”

Hey man, real life’s a drag
Let’s have some fun
Well hey man, real life’s a drag sometimes
So let’s have some fun

The first time that we smoked a joint
We got high and listened to a little Pink Floyd
And he said, “Boy, there’s a lot I wish I did”
“Well me, I’m stuck in this old life but if you could be happy, that would be nice”
“There’s a big world out there for you kid”
“So go out and conquer it”
“So go out and conquer it”

Hey man, real life’s a drag
Let’s have some fun
Well hey man, real life’s a drag sometimes
So let’s have some fun

I said, hey man, real life’s a drag sometimes
But let’s have some fun
Hey man, real life’s a drag sometimes
But let’s have some fun
