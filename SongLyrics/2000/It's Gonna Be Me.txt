[Intro: Lance & Justin]
It's gonna be me
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin]
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

[Verse 2: JC]
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind, to see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

[Interlude: Justin, Lance & All]
It's gonna be me
Oh, yeah
There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna
It's gonna be me

[Bridge: All]
All that I do is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it but I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love, guess what (guess what)

[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

[Outro: All & Justin]
Every little thing I do (All that I do)
Never seems enough for you (Is not enough for you)
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (When finally)
Get to love somebody
Guess what (Guess what)
It's gonna be me
