[Spoken Intro]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

[Hook]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like, like, like acid rock?

[Refrain]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

[Chorus]
Music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Verse]
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie (uh-uh!)
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel
