[Hook]
Y'all gonna make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gonna make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse]
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick
All your mens up in the jail before, FONDLE MY TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT
And all them other cats you get RUBBED, dumb quick
How the FISH you gonna cross the dog with some bum SHOE?
There goes the FLESHLIGHT, nine one one SPATULA
All over dumb SPATULA, ain't that some SPATUALA
VACUUMS remind me of a strip club
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my TAINT STABBED
And i don't know who the SNUGGIE you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, DEFENESTRATED next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin that, now cause they miss you
SCRODUM a SPEEDO tried to diss you
That's why you SUCKING on your THUMB, lookin at the roof of the church
PROCTOLOGIST tellin the truth and it hurts
