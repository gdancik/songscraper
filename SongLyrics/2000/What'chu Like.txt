Lights out when I lean and I swerve
Black Metaphor keeps feeding the urge
Bars at your flock that's a walk in the park chase them out
Who the fuck keeps feeding these birds?
I'm just out here trying to enjoy the view
Double cup club Redbull Malibu
I'm gonna need checks real quick back to back
Need my own lane when I come zooming through
Little snake clutch for the blade that I took ID little weed and some make up in it
Niggas got dreams just to wake up in it
Girls with the cake getting baked up in it
Boss in my town throwing 3s in the A with a dude that'll shoot in a New York minute
Yeah but I'm cool in the day live for the night
Smoke what you want,  go on do what you like like like

Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
'Cause I’m cool in the day, live for the night
Smoke what you want, go on do what you like

Came from a place where I doubt you can make it
If you want mine get in line trying to take it
I've been on my two tears in a bucket
While your girls while outside bucked naked
When you go on face it I can see stress
Half your team lost need a GPS
Dutch been a G, PS please don't test
Sincerely who's next
Keep a bouquet for my Black Rose clique
I've been through things that'll make you sick
Came from the slums with the chicks carry drums
Went to knock I am not talking EQ shit
Dutch been the lead never background chick
Back to the block 'cause that clock gon' tick
Yeah but I'm cool in the day, live for the night
Smoke what you want go on do what you like like like

Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
Smoke what you want, do what you like (whatcha like like, whatcha like)
'Cause I’m cool in the day, live for the night
Smoke what you want, go on do what you like
