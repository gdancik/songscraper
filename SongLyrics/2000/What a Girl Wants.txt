[Intro]
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms (yeah, come on)

Ooh ooh oh, hey yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together, hmm
While I figured it out
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart it was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And it's lucky for me you understand

[Chorus]
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

Ooh ooh, oh oh yeah yeah

What I want is what you got
And what you got, is what I want

[Verse 2]
A weaker man might have walked away
But you had faith
Strong enough to move over and give me space
While I got it together, yeah
While I figured it out
They say if you love something, let it go
If it comes back it's yours, that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more than...

[Chorus]
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

Oh baby, oh darling
Thank you, thank you, oh yeah

[Bridge]
A girl needs somebody sensitive but tough
Somebody there when the goin' gets rough
Every night he'll be giving his love (he'll be giving his love)
To just one girl, one girl (to one girl, oh)
Somebody cool but tender too (somebody real cool but tender too)
Somebody baby, just like you
Can keep me hanging around
With the one who always knew...

[Hook]
(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
(Whatever makes me happy sets you free)
Ooh oh, I'm thanking you for being there for me
(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
(Whatever keeps me in your arms)
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I need
Oh woah...

[Chorus]
(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
Oh oh woah, yeah (whatever makes me happy sets you free)
Always what I'm thinking (and I'm thanking you)
Always what I want, what I need (for giving it to me)
What a girl wants you got, yeah yeah (what a girl wants, what a girl needs)
(Whatever keeps me in your arms)
Oh baby, I thank you 'cause you know, oh ooh woah
(And I'm thanking you for being there for me)

[Half-Chorus]
What you got is what I need (what a girl wants, what a girl needs)
And you want... ha ha ha (Whatever makes me happy sets you free)
What I want, ooh oh yeah (and I'm thanking you for knowing exactly)

[Outro]
Oh baby, oh darling
Thank you, thank you for giving me what I need
And what I want
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh yeah
I turn around there
Whenever you're not there
Oh yeah yeah yeah (a girl wants)...
