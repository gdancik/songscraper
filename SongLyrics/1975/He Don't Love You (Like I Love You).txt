[Chorus]
He don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

[Verse 1]
Tell me I should not be feeling what I am today
Tell me to silence my heart
Tell me we've been here before
And I will walk away from your love

[Pre-Chorus]
For there is a wall between you and I
And he hasn't been treating you right
I've been watching it all
I've seen you cry
And I just gotta tell you tonight

[Chorus]
That he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

[Verse 2]
Tell me this love's just a feeling and
Will pass away
Tell me your heart is a liar
Tell me you're not what I know you are
All that a man could desire

[Pre-Chorus]
And he doesn't know
Darling, what he's got
But I would treasure you
If you give me a chance
I will make you smile
I will give you a love that's true

[Chorus]
But he don't love you like I love you...
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

[Bridge]
So why can you not see
The place in your heart that was made for me
Why must you hide yourself away
And why must you fight
The way that I'm holding your hand tonight
Take a chance and give your heart to me

[Chorus]
But he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you
He don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you
He don't love you like I love you (for there is a wall)
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children (and he doesn't know)
He don't wanna build his life around you
