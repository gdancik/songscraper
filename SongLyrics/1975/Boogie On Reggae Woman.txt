[Verse 1]
I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor
I like to do it to you
'Til you holler for more
I like to reggae
But you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you
So you can make me scream

[Chorus]
So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me?
Boogie on reggae woman
Baby, can't you see?

[Verse 2]
I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you
Under the stars above â€” yes, I would
I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love, yeah
I'd like to see you in the raw
Under the stars above

[Chorus]
So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with you?
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do?

[Harmonica solo]
Can I play?
Can I play?
Ow!

[Chorus]
Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with you?
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do? Yeah
Boogie on reggae woman
Let me do it to you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do?

[Outro: Harmonica solo]
