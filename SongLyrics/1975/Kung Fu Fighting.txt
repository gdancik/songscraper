[Intro]
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 1]
There were funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up and they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip, and kicking from the hip

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening, hell, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 2]
There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said: "Here comes the big boss, lets get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swinging with the hand
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand new trip

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing

Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ha
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
Make sure you have expert timing
Kung-fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...
