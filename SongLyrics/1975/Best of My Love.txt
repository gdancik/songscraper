[Verse 1]
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams

[Break]
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

[Break]
That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

[Refrain]
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus]
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh Sweet darling
You get the best of my love

[Bridge]
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

[Verse 3]
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

[Bridge]
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

[Refrain]
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
