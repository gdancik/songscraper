(Wait.) Oh yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman
(Wait.) Wa-a-a-ait, Mr. Postman
Please Mr. Postman, look and see.  (Oh yeah.)
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please Mr. Po-o-ostman.)
'Cause it's been a mighty long time (Whoa, yeah.)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

There must be some word today
From my boyfriend who's so far away
Please Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mr. Postman
So-o, so patiently
For a card or just a letter saying he's returning home to me

Please Mr. Postman
Please Mr. Postman, look and see.  (Oh yeah.)
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please Mr. Po-o-ostman.)
'Cause it's been a mighty long time (Whoa, yeah.)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

So many days, you've passed me by
You saw the tears standing in my eye
You wouldn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Please Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, oh yeah, in your bag for me
You know it's been so long, (Postman, postman.)
Yeah, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

You better wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Whoa, you better wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please, please Mr. Postman.  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please check and see just one more time for me
You better wait, wait a minute.  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Please Mr. Postman.  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute please, Mr. Postman, wait
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
