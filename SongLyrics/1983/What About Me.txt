[Verse 1]
Well, there's a little boy waiting
At the counter of the corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says

[Chorus]
What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a pretty girl serving
At the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop
Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

[Chorus]
What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give
More than you give

[Bridge]
Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young
But they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
"What about me?"

[Verse 3]
And now I'm standing on the corner
All the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got

[Chorus]
What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more
What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more, you just take more
You just take more than you give

[Outro]
What about me?
What about me?
What about me?
