I could hardly believe it when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it
Tell me about the plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go
Tell me how am supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
How am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
How can I blame you
When I build my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much
More than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
I need you now, it's more than I can take
Tell me how am supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Now that your dream has come true
Tell me how am supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on?
All that I've been livin' for is gone

Without you
After I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed...
