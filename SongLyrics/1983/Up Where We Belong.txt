[Verse 1]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

[Refrain]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow

[Verse 1]
Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

[Refrain]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

[Bridge]
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
