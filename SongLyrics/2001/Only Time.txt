[Verse 1]
Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time

[Outro]
Who knows? Only time
Who knows? Only time
