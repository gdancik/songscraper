[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold 9 million

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhalin'
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self-destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?) (Yeah)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?) (Yeah)
I'm a survivor (What?)

I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?) (Keep on survivin', yeah)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?) (Yeah)
I'm not gon' stop (What?) (I'm not)
I'm gon' work harder (What?) (I'm gon' work harder, yeah)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?) (I will survive, yeah)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

[Bridge 1: Kelly Rowland]
I'm wishin' you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' blast you on the radio (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' lie on you and your familia (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines ('m better than that)
I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity (I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon' diss you on the internet
'Cause my mama taught me better than that

[Chorus]

I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?) (Hey)

I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)

I'm a survivor (What?) (I'm a survivor, yeah)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

[Bridge 2: Michelle Williams]
After all of the darkness and sadness
Soon comes happiness
If I surround myself with positive things
I'll gain prosperity

I will survive being bootylicious
