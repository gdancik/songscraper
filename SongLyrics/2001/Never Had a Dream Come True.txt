[Intro: Jo]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1: Jo]
Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

[Pre-Chorus: Jo]
There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

[Chorus: Jo & All]
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though, I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (the one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

[Verse 2: Jo]
Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Jo & (All)]
There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

[Chorus: Jo & All]
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though, I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (the one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

[Bridge: Jo]
You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will, you know you will, oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

[Pre-Chorus: Jo & (All)]
There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (and funny thing)
No matter how I try and try, I just can't say goodbye
No, no, no, no

[Chorus: Jo & All]
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though, I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (the one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be
A part of me will always be with you
Oh-oh
