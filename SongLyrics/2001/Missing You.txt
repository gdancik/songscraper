> "50" by MellowHype

Original Annotation:
40 acres and a mule was the plan by the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction to help the former slaves prosper and make a living by giving them land. It got turned down and never passed because some felt it was too harsh on the South, not like they were not harsh on the slaves…

Also a typical OF contradiction/oxymoron, since mules are hybrid animals, meaning they’re not fertile at all

Suggestion:
The plan was orchestrated by the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, with Oliver Howard as the leader. The phrase “forty acres and a mule” was created by General William Sherman who originally came up with the idea. Besides re-distributing land, the Bureau’s main function was fostering education, which is why colleges such as Howard University are named after members of this Bureau, among others.
It should be noted that the plan of land redistribution was struck down in court, for the Southerners whose land was being taken took this matter to court, where it was ruled unconstitutional to take this land, even if it was abandoned during the Civil War.

> "Where Did the Party Go" by Fall Out Boy

Original Annotation (SLA):
See annotation.

Suggestion Type: Missing Something

Suggestion:
This was the first song written in the recording process of Save Rock & Roll. It was mainly done by Fall Out Boy (FOB) bass player/backing vocalist Pete Wentz and singer/rhythm guitar player Patrick Stump. Its creation was suggested by Wentz and came after Stumps’s long blog entry “We Liked You Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah.” Wentz suggested the attempts be made in an effort to have a creative outlet again. After multiple efforts to make something new acompanied with failures, “Where Did the Party Go” was born, exciting both Wentz and Stump. Following their approval of their new creation, drummer Andy Hurley and lead guitarist Joe Trohman reunited with Stump and Wentz at their manager’s house in NY to plan the new album.

> "Jeopardy" by Run the Jewels

Original Annotation:
Mike starts off the album with heavy use of “izzle” slang, first used as part of jive talk by pimps and hustlers in New York, and later popularized by Snoop Dogg.

This sort of pseudo language which is also known as izzo for adding iz in front of the first vowel in the syllable can be used to disguise words for people to use amongst themselves. Here he is disguising Nikes, pipe, knife, right, fright, Mike and then right once again.

Excluding the izzles, Mike is telling us he’s up and about at night, scaring his enemies with the variety of weapons he has with him.

Suggestion:
Snoop Dogg goes on to reappear in the Meow the Jewels counterpart of this song, “Meowpurrdy”. Snoop is used in the sample the song is built upon and is featured in a new skit tagged on to the beginning that occurred between Killer Mike and Snoop Dogg himself.

> "Faaip de Oiad" by Tool

Original Annotation (SLA):
The title is Enochian for “Voice of God.”

The talking is from a radio call-in show (Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell). It is one of the classic moments from that show, during which the caller claims to be a former Area 51 employee, and that the military was out to get him. Oddly enough, the satellite which carried that show suddenly died (losing the feed to some fifty stations) during the broadcast. The caller later admitted that the story was a hoax.

Suggestion:
If you play this song over “Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)” by Tool, it terminates right as the dialogue in that song picks up. It is commonly believed that this ties into the aforementioned song, which the segues into “Rosetta Stoned”. Many think that the three songs together make a story.

> "Parking Lot" by Tyler, the Creator (feat. Casey Veggies & Mike G)

Original Annotation:
Sam is after Wolf after discovering that he’s hanging out with Salem, his girlfriend:

"Oh, she with that new dude, Wolf
Hey you know where they went?
I seen ‘em going down by the lake"

He’s pretty angry now and clearly wants to put an end to their relationship by killing him, but Wolf is going to face Sam and kill him first.

Notice that between where Wolf says ‘what the fuck you mean kill me?’ and ‘slow down,’ the dude in the background (Lionel) says, “You got a booger in your nose!” I thought it was pretty fucking silly.

Suggestion Type: Missing Something

Suggestion:
It should be noted that during the skit, the riff for “Rusty” [the next track] begins playing in the background. This is relevant, seeing as how the skit at the end of “Parking Lot” ties in to how “Rusty” ends: Sam killing Earl and loudly questioning where Wolf can be found.

Suggestion Type: Other

Suggestion:
The current annotation has some personal commentary, kinda; it’s a bit questionable.

> "Don't Hug Me I'm Scared 5" by This is It (Collective)

Original Annotation:
I feel like this line has hidden significance. This mirrors exactly what the recording says in the previous episode, right before Harry’s head popped.

Suggestion:
Your tone is quite subjective; you should be more firm and certain in your annotations. Don't speculate about stuff; instead, present it as fact and back it up with arguments/sources.
