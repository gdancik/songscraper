[Verse 1]
I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

[Verse 2]
I think you're already leavin'
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need, this in my life and
I think I'm scared, I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

[Chorus]
If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home (Oh, come home)
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

[Verse 3]
I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need more than you mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need, this in my life
I think I'm just scared, that I know too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

[Chorus]
If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby, you need to come home (Aw, come home)
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared, do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

[Chorus]
If you're gone
Then maybe it's time to come home
Well, there's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
Yeah, well if you're gone
Hell, baby you need to come home (Oh, come home)
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

[Outro]
Something me
Everything in...
Something me
In you
