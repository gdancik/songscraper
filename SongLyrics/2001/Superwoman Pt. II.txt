And it's hard to think positive
When people you considered friends, turned out to be fucking pricks
And maybe if I tried a little harder, I could see it from their point of view
And maybe if I tried, I would understand, but I'm not gonna lie

And maybe if I stayed out a little longer
Maybe if I drank that bottle of wine
Maybe if I did the drugs that they did maybe things would be fine

I can't, I won't, I don't relate to you
Yes, I know this is true

And I've given up on a friendship with you
You can keep your dollars and cents
And I've given up, I've got a problem with your attitude
A real problem with it
