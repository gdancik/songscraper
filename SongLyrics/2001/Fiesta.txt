[Hook: Lil Trav]
Now I be crackin' and rollin', all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be goin'
Rock Trues and Robin's, Trav's who they jockin'
I got the fe fe rockin', Tron, flats, and molly
Like get money, we spend it, shake it open catchin'
This kush I bring we hit it, rollin' kush I been it
It’s crackin' I'm rollin', all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be goin'

[Verse 1: Lil Trav]
Say Sicko what’s poppin', ball like Houston Rockets
All I know is swerve and swag, and tall money is knockin'
And our bullets are so vicious, got your ass stop wishing
I’m on you like a mission, like a mess is in here
We can’t lose so we winnin', that’s why I be grinnin'
I’m poppin' all the ecstasy, my night is just beginnin'
Rolling stone tatted, speak country, what’s happenin'?
These bitch niggas be wildin', cause contracts I be signin'
My Gucci hat is linen, all my hoes they out here get it
On my pimping if you with it, hope this SK make him ribbit
Till they stop it, bullets hittin', like Wayne with no ceilings
And we mobbin', mobbin', say Sicko yeah we comin'

[Hook: Lil Trav]
Now I be crackin' and rollin', all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be goin'

Like get money, we spend it, shake it open catchin'
This kush I bring we hit it, rollin' kush I been it
It’s crackin' I'm rollin', all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be goin'

[Verse 2: Lil Ceno]
My hoes they be rockin', I got bands in my pocket
And Sicko steady mobbin', got hella rocks and Robins
I’m tatted like a Mexican, these hoes know I be flexin' man
I’m on the end no checkin' in, and I don’t do no flodgin'
Out west we be cuttin' though, we see little thots in booty shorts
They hop up in a vino, and you know we be goin' up
They hit up the liquor store, then we hit the fe fe up
We bail out and they jockin' us, cause my whole team be dreaded up
Sicko and them be Guccied up, Sicko and them be Louied up
We got these bitches goin' crazy, that’s the word around our town
Big bands in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet
Get off my dick i’m stunting, got the baddest bitches watchin'

[Hook: Lil Trav]
Now I be crackin' and rollin', all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be goin'

[Verse 3: Young Heavy]
Sicko be rockin', rollin', damn it bitch we tottin'
Keep it crackin' no loafin', bad bitches I’m strokin'
She give me top, she chokin', boppin' and rollin'
Gucci on me in motion, he talking till he frozen
Pistol on me I’m sparkin', parade on his block, we marchin'
Clean the gun, no flaugin' I shoot to hit my target
Sicko rushin', they mobbin' And we don’t do no talkin'
A&R to the ?, you don’t want no problems
