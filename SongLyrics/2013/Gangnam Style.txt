Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

You don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
I said you don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!


It was editing code, until my head explodes
My first vow was a wedding poem
It's Dennis the Menace clothes
But heaven knows
I won't stop until my debit grows
They want to take with no, “Thanks!”
I “IQ” when I’m I.T
They might Brexit your whole bank
And then Trump up your ID!
Now its firing rounds from a pirate house
Flame retarded in fireman trousers
The type of drought, the most-high-ness vowed
I've come to burn your false idols down!
Truth or dare in the end, end up dead in end
Send them where in the end?
Woo...Rick Flair in the air


I’m like you don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
It's why we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!


Now it’s ‘feats of God’, the features of...
I run tracks until my feet are gone
The preacher of peace .com
To choose the red, white and blues that
Lisa Drop
I am neither lost, nor the meaning of...
They’re just meaningless toppings of pizza
On top of pizza box
Two fingers up and ‘Peace!’ them off
I need the gwop, I need the wop...
Gangnam style with the dance plan
RSI with the handstand
Trust me I need to bop!
Jheeze! Neither A$AP Rocky nor Aesop Rock
But the tower they’re preaching from
I’ll be towering Ps until I’m
‘Tower of Pisa’ long!
Like, like “I'm really soz!”
Like, like I’m in realer than real
What's really good? What's really God?
They don't feel what I feel
There's no reason to chill
When you’re channeling roots that were cleaning the fields
I’ve be channeling shit without TV and film
Just from kings and queens in their field, I'm ill


I’m like you don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
(All black all black)
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
(Yeah it's not like that)
I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!

I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!

You don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
I was covered in black
I was covered in black
I was covered in black
I was covered in...

I'm like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!
You're like them in the end!
Not like them in the end!

I’m you don't really want it we've got knowledge to the coffin
So we’re covered in black
I was covered in black
They don't really want the logic with the knowledge
I mean they've got it but they're not like that
And it’s not like that..
