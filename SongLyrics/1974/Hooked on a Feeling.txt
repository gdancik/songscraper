[Intro]
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga

[Verse 1]
I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me
When you hold me in your arms so tight
You let me know everything's all right

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

[Verse 2]
Lips as sweet as candy, its taste is on my mind
Girl, you got me thirsty for another cup o' wine
Got a bug from you, girl, but I don't need no cure
I'll just stay a victim if I can for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
All the good love when we're all alone
Keep it up, girl, yeah, you turn me on

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

[Bridge]
All the good love
(Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga)
When we're all alone
(Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga)
Keep it up, girl
(Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga)
Yeah, you turn me on
(Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga)

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
I'm hooked on a feeling
And high on believing
That you're in love with me
I said I'm hooked on a feeling
And I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
