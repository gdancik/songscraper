[Chorus]
Jet!
Jet!

[Verse 1]
Jet, I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were gonna be marrying soon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And Jet, I thought the only lonely place was on the moon

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Verse 2]
Jet, was your father as bold as a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And Jet, I thought the Major was a Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

[Instrumental Bridge]
Jet!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And Jet, I thought the Major was a little Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

[Verse 3]
Jet, with the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back, and we'll go for a ride in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And Jet, I thought that the Major was a little Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And Jet, you know I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette

[Outro]
Jet! (ooh)
A little lady
My little lady, yes, oh
