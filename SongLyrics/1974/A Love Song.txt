[Verse 1]
There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you

[Verse 2]
Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you 'cause

[Chorus]
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

[Verse 3]
Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you

[Verse 4]
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I wanna sing to you
Love is what I bring to you and I wanna sing to you, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
