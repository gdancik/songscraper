[Verse 1]
Hey kid, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh, my soul
Hey kid, boogie too, did ya?
Hey shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in them blue suede shoes
Hey kid, rock and roll, rock on

[Bridge]
And where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear

[Verse 2]
Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
James Dean

[Bridge]
And where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear

[Verse 3]
Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
Jimmy Dean

[Break]
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on

[Verse 4]
Hey kids
Rock and roll
Rock on

[Hook]
Rock on
Hey, hey
Rock and roll
Rock on

[Hook x2]
