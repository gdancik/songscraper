[Verse 1]
Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you
Mama, you
Mama, you

[Segue]

[Verse 2]
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away to a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

[Segue]

[Verse 3]
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 4]
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the Village Square
For the rabbits on the run

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run

Yeah, the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 5]
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the County Judge, who held a grudge
Will search forevermore
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
