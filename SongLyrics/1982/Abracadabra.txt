[Verse 1]
I heat up, I can't cool down
You got me spinnin'
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame, full of desire
Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher

[Chorus]
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

[Verse 3]
You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

[Chorus]
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

[Verse 4]
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

[Verse 5]
I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

[Chorus]
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

[Verse 2]
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round

I heat up, (I heat up) I can't cool down (I can't cool down)
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)
I heat up, (I heat up) I can't cool down (I can't cool down)
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)
I heat up, (I heat up) I can't cool down (I can't cool down)
