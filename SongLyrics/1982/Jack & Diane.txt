[Verse 1]
Little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jack, he's gonna be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jacky's car

[Verse 2]
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks, now do what I please"
Say a....

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
I say, oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Now walk on

[Verse 3]
Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we ought to run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' nothing"
But Jacky say a...

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah I say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

[Bridge]
Gonna let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

[Outro]
A little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids doing the best they can
