[​​Intro]​​

[Verse 1]
All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
Rosanna

[Verse 2]
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

[Pre-Chorus]
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Chorus]
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah

[Verse 3]
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
Rosanna

[Verse 4]
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Chorus]
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah

​[Bridge​]

[Pre-Chorus]
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Chorus]
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah

Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
