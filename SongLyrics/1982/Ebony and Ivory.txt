[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh lord, why don't we?

[Verse]
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
And we learn to live, we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh lord, why don't we?

[Bridge]
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, ooh

[Verse]
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh lord, why don't we?
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh lord, why don't we?

[Outro]
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
