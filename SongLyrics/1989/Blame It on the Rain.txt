[Verse 1]
You said you didn't need her
You told her goodbye (goodbye)
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wish that you still had her (had her)
And you feel like such a fool

You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
(Gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

[Verse 2]
Should've told her you were sorry (sorry)
Coulda said you were wrong
But no, you couldn't do that
You had to prove you were strong
Oh, if you hadn't been so blinded (blinded)
She might still be there with you

You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
(Gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Come on and blame it on the rain
'Cause the rain don't mind
And the rain don't care
You've got to blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
You can blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain, baby
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
Blame it, blame it on the rain

Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain
