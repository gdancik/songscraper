'Detta say love, 'detta say loyalty
Before you fuck with the family, just try 'memba me

Haffi protect the dawg dem, 'memba anuh nuff of we
The money, the fame, no mean nothing to me
If you a pree one a mi bredda dem, you haffi pree me
O-o-oh!

[Verse 1]
After all, after all
Dawg dem just a wait pon a call
Four rifle lean up pon a wall
Unmarked car (errk!)
Drive up, pull up a him foot
Bwoy spread out like say him deh a him yard
Dead a road like dog (pow!)
Yo, we a go hard, we a go hard
Diss who fa bredda? You mussi mad!

Who me no like, you no like
Who me a war, you a war

[Chorus]
Me have couple dawg would buss any head fi me
'Detta say love, 'detta say loyalty
Before you fuck with the family, just try 'memba me
(Me nah sell out, me cyan sell out)
Gun inna hand, yuh would swear we ah police

If you a pree one a mi quenga dem, you haffi pree me
Oh

[Verse 2]
Yo Lee
This a the link, this a the cord
Mi friend dem wild nuh bloodclot
Ever high, no love talk
Who smile, no love laugh
Sittin jump off, then we mind mek up fast
'Bout fi drop a bomb, yo, the timer just start
Rasclaat, see it deh, the MAK 90 just bark
Babylon a come, but the sniper just pass (Shush)
Mi striker dem full of style and nuff craft
As you a say "A who dat?" is a life a cut short
Shot a stop inna forehead, it swell fast
Full of tool like we sell parts
Weh di 'matic, send 'cross
Bwoy  body lost, cyan find
Couldn't get a proper send off
Me know dem and dem friend soft
Bwoy weh love chat tough no fi endz off (Careful)
Man diss you inna yuh place, defend that
We no the type fi send chat (Careful!)
Dem kill mi friend, dem haffi dead back (Careful!)
Uptown have mi head top and mi head back
Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus]
Me have couple dawg weh buss any head fi me
'Detta say love, 'detta say loyalty
Before you fuck with the family, just try 'memba me
(Me nah sell out, me cyan sell out)
Me a talk 'bout gun inna hand, you swear, think we a police
Fi run a program pon a man, that a the least
If you a pree one of mi bredda dem, you haffi pree me
Oh

[Verse 3]
How you mean? How you mean?
Never go nowhere without the team
Send a strange man fi slap you 'way, you goodly hail him when you see him
From bwoy fi dead, count me in
All we waan fi do a live the dream
How you mean? How you mean?
Me feel it to mi heart when mi bredda Jhavere drop out
Him was only sixteen...
If Nesbeth did deh yah, amount of boy woulda tap out
But we a gwan hold it fi him

[Chorus]
Listen to me
'Detta say love, 'detta a say loyalty
Before you fuck with the family, just try 'memba me
Yo Frass, me a talk 'bout gun inna hand you swear think we a police
We send couple dawg deh pon the way, dem soon reach
You a pree one of di quenga, you haffi pree me

[Outro]
Me nah sell out, me cyan sell out
