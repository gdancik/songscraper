[Verse 1: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]
Baby, I get so scared inside and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne & Lita Ford]
Sometimes it's hard to hold on so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in
Your warm and darkened grave?

[Chorus: Lita Ford]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

[Post-Chorus: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]
Will you ever take me? No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me? No, I'll never feel the same

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Lita Ford]
I know I been so hard on you
I know I told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

[Chorus: Lita Ford]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same? Oh, yeah

[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]
Close your eyes, close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me
