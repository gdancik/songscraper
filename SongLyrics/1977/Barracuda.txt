[Intro]

[Verse 1]
So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

[Chorus]
You lying so low into the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now won't you, Barracuda?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

[Chorus]
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda

[Bridge]
"Sell me sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
I think that you got the blues, too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick

Oh, Bara-Barracuda

[Outro]
