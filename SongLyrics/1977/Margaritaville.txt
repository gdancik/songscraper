[Verse 1]
Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp
They're beginnin' to boil

[Chorus]
Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

[Verse 2]
Don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

[Chorus]
Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

[Verse 3]
I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there’s booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

[Chorus]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
But I know it’s my own damn fault

[Outro]
Yes, and
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
And I know it’s my own damn fault
