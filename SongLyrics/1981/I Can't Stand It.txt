[Verse 1]
You've been told
So maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold
Maybe it's time that you earned

[Chorus]
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

[Verse 2]
I'll explain
I feel like I'm being used
Make it plain
So you don't get confused

[Chorus][x2]
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

[Verse 3]
It's time
Time for me to let you know
It's no crime
No crime to let your feelings show

[Chorus]
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart
