[Intro]
Where do we go from here, now that all of the children are growin' up?
And how do we spend our lives if there's no one to lend us a hand?

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading away

[Chorus 1]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say are not right
If I promised you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

[Modified Intro]
Where do we go from here, now that all of the children have grown up?
And how do we spend our time knowing nobody gives us a damn?

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading away

[Chorus 2]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

[Chorus 1]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say are not right
If I promise you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

[Chorus 2]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night
