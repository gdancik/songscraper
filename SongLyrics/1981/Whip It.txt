[Verse 1]
Demi Lovato on my wrist (On my wrist, on my wrist)
I'm a superstar, take a pic with your bitch
Dressed in all white, smoking light green dope
When I hop out the whip you'll think it's Demi Lovato
That's yo' girl, why she dancin' like a hoe?
My bitch lap dancin' in the night just like a hoe
I'm glistening on yo' bitch
Demi Lovato on my wrist (On my wrist)

[Verse 2]
Ay, Demi Lovato on my wrist, yuh (My wrist, yuh)
I got a model on my wrist, yuh (My wrist, aye)
I'm in LA, [?] off the cocaine (Cocaine)
I'm in LA, bitch I want the fame (Demi Lovato)
Gucci Escalade take over the lane (Skrrt)
Ay, I'ma stay the same, bitch I'll never change
Yuh, I be out this shit, still smokin' dope
I be on this shit, still smokin' dope
I be out this shit, ay
Still smokin' dope
I'm tryna get dope, ain't worried 'bout no hoe
Why the fuck Yung Bruh look like Demi Lovato? (Yuh)
Yuh, I should let my wrist put through my [?] (Yuh)
