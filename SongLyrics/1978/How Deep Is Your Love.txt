[Verse 1]
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Verse 2]
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da-da
Na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Pre-Chorus]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
