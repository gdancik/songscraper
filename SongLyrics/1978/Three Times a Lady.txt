[Verse 1]
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

[Chorus]
You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

[Verse 2]
You shared my dreams
My joys
My pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again, dear
I'd spend each and every moment with you

[Chorus]
You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

[Verse 3]
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you
To hold you
To feel you
To need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

[Chorus]
You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you
