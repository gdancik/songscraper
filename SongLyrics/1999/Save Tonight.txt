[Verse 1]
Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me and a bottle of wine
Going to hold you tonight, uh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let's delay our misery

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Verse 2]
There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away, oh it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go, oh
Lord I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Bridge]
Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Girl you know I've got to go, oh
Lord I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Outro]
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Oh, that's right
Save tonight
