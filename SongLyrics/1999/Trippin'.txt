[Chorus]
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang

[Verse 1]
I'm set trippin' on you niggas
Y'all don't bleed like I bleed, I'm gorilla
The homies mad cause some crips is my hittas
I do a show, drop a bag, they gonna get ya
I'm colorblind, I can't see shit
But this mac on my dresser with a full clip
I don't crack under pressure, fuck the bullshit
When I slide, homicide, then a news clip
Reporting live from your hood
On the 5 I wish you would
Come around me with that fake shit
Throwing gang signs, we don't say shit
Applying pressure when I run him down
I'ma start G-checking all you fuckin' clowns
One question, are you fuckin' down?
Wrong answer, here's a hunnid rounds

[Chorus]
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang

[Bridge]
Who brought you home, how you turn blood?
Who loc'd you in, how you turn cuz?
Who brought you home, how you turn blood?
Who loc'd you in, how you turn cuz?

[Verse 2]
Give it to a nigga right in broad day
On his block, fuck a warning shot, let 'em all spray
Throwin' shots, right in front of cops, wit a long K
Fuck a opp, let his body rot in his hallway
He got hit, she got hit, then the V flipped
Try and run, shots fired, then his knees clipped
Snatch his flag, now he mad, I'ma polygraph
Why you lyin', now you lyin' in a bodybag

[Chorus]
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Punch you in the face, muthafucka I knock ya teeth out
Every time I come through, nigga I got my heat out
If you want smoke, ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that be 'bout
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood, you ain't even gang

[Bridge]
Who brought you home, how you turn blood?
Who loc'd you in, how you turn cuz?
Who brought you home, how you turn blood?
Who loc'd you in, how you turn cuz?
