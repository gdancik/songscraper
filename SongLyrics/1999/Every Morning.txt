[Intro]
Every morning there's a halo hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand

[Verse 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
(Sugar Ray say)
Ohh
(Every morning)
Ohh
(Every morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Ohh
(She always rights the wrong, she always rights, she always rights)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Verse 2]
Every morning there's a heartache hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

[Pre-Chorus]
Something so deceiving, when you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
Ohh
(Every morning)
Ohh
(Every morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Ohh
(Every morning)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Bridge]
She always rights the wrong
For me
Baby
She always rights the wrong
For me

[Verse 3]
Every morning there's a halo hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand

[Chorus]
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every morning
Every morning (Turn me around again)
Every morning (Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Every morning (Do it again)
Every morning when I wake up
Every morning
