[Verse 1: Justin]
Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin]
I never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

[Chorus: All (with Justin)]
Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(A little more time, yes he did, baby)

[Verse 2: JC]
In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

[Pre-Chorus: JC]
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
That's deep inside
Leaves me purified

[Chorus: (with JC)]
Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep (And deep)
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, on you, on you, you)
(On you, on you, on you, you) Ohh
(On you, on you, on you, you)
(On you, on you, on you, you) Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Justin]
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

[Chorus: All]
Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep (And deep)
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, on you, on you, you)
God must have spent
A little more time, on you
(On you, on you, you, you, oh yeah)
A little more time
On you...
