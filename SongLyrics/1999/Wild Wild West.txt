[Intro: Offset]
Hey

[Chorus: Offset]
Wild, wild West (Wild, wild)
And I put the coolant on the TEC (Coolant)
And I bought some land, I invest (Who?)
Oh, stepping on a peasant (Oh)
Woah, shawty gon' molest me (Woah)
Bought a Richard Millie, you get the message (Richard Millie)
And I’m Migo Gang like a Mexican (Gang)
Introduce you to the gang with your bestie (Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
Hoppin' out the V with a freak (Out the V with a)
Blue hundreds stacking up neat (Blue hunduns)
You can get whacked in a week (Whacked)
She got a big old booty, good physique (Ooh, hoo)
In the jacuzzi, rubbin' on my feet (Hey)
She so bad, she don’t wanna talk or speak (Bad)
A lot of cash, say she love it when I speak (Cash)
New baguettes, they look like water out the sea (Baguettes)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Blow your brains, turn you to a sunroof (Blow your brains)
Make the stick kit hit, kung-fu (Wah)
Spend a hundred, let the zombie hunt you (Spend a hundred)
Get you whacked when I sneeze, hachoo (Hachoo, whacked)
Millionaires comin' through in white suits (Millionaires)
Send the gang to come and snipe you (Send the gang)
Yoga Flame, hit 'em with the Ryu (yoga flame)
She givin' brain, this an In-N-Out move (Woo)
I'ma put her in a Rover, fuck her in her Fashion Nova (Who?)
Baguettes in the AP and it's cold like Minnesota ('Guettes)
Double up the dose, she put a four up in the soda (Four)
Tryna get this 'yola while the devil on my shoulder (’Yola)
Like a snake, bet the stick bite your ass just like a cobra
You can hate, fuck your bitch, I’ma fuck her on the cover
When you up, yeah, they love you, don't forget about your brother
55 Bel Air, I got it bloody when I gut it (Gut it)
Thought I was a sucker, make the chopper uppercut him (Uh)
Gotta meet up with the gang, I’m like the coach, I call the huddle (Gang)
Drippin' when I'm steppin', got me leavin’ back a puddle (Woo)
Get a nigga stretched, real quiet, real subtle (Stretched)
Big dawg status, don't play with this shit (Beast)
Fuck around and spend a half a mil' on a hit (Who?)
I'ma make a million off the rip (Who?)
And I can snap my fingers, get you flipped (Hey)

[Chorus: Offset]
Wild, wild West (Wild, wild)
And I put the coolant on the TEC (Coolant)
And I bought some land, I invest (Who?)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I'm the man with the plan (Uh-huh)
I could put a shark on land (Shark on land)
They like, "Damn, that nigga cool as a fan" (Cool as a fan)
Drippin', leakin' like a faucet again (Faucet again)
I got real pretty vibes in the pad (In the pad)
Just a spot, got Chanel pot and pans (Chanel pot and pans)
Lamborghini, come catch it if you can (Come and catch it if you can)
Young GunWunna and I'm dressing like the ranch (I'm dressing like the ranch)
Fifty thousand for the car, fuck the cost
Z06 Vette slidin', paint it slime like the Hulk (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hard top but any given time it come off (Any given time it come off)
Baguettes in the face got my time hella off (Time hella off)
Headed from the South to the North (North)
Gunna worldwide, I be drippin' hot sauce (Hot sauce)
I done put my balls in the hole like golf (Golf)
I'm the one they call when the bros take a loss (Call when the bros take a loss)
Had to keep it real with you, dawg (Uh-huh)
Pour a pint in a liter and it still ain't dissolve (Nah)
When I land, got my greeter overseas in the mall
Type of Porsche is two-seater, I'ma speed it and park (I'm speedin')
Cops pulled me over, I had weed in my drawers
Yeezys, Balmains, diamonds, you can see 'em in the dark (On God)
All blue but I'm slime, fuck your mind and your thoughts (Thoughts)
Kill him while we ridin' in the real triple cross (Triple cross)

[Chorus: Offset]
