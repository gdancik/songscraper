I'm lookin' for Mrs. Bubble Gum

'Cause I stay so hard
You can suck me for a long time
Oh my God

And I'm really geeked up
And I got mo' dro'

But yo laffy taffy got me froze (oh)
Get loose (oh)
Get low (oh)
Don't be shy

C'mon trick, c'mon trick

I like the way you break it down
Waddle, stop you watchin' me
Laffy taffy I'm likin' this
Big ole ass you shakin' bitch
Close yo mouth and don't say shit
Bend on ova and hit a split
Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, yo ankles swell
Girl, lemme touch ya

Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that ho
All this money just hit the flo'

[Verse 3]
Say baby girl
Ay what you gon' do
I got a hundred ones
I wanna po' on you
Just keep that ass shakin'
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a playa
Sippin' grey goose
Feelin' all loose
'Cause girl you on yo job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On the stilettos
You made it skeet-skeet-skeet
Like a water hose (candy girl)
Got me goin' in my pocket pullin' out mo' dough
Let the waitress know I need to order, five hundred mo'
You best believe later on we headed to the mo'
So go on and pack them bags
And let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on yo fine ass
At the front do'
Girl, you don't know
I'mma toss that laffy taffy
Toss it, flip it, and slap it
Bust a couple of nuts
And get right back at it

[Chorus]
Girl, shake dat laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, (shake) that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy (candy girl)
That laffy taffy
Girl, shake dat laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, (shake) that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy (candy girl)
That laffy taffy
