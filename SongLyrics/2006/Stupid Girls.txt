VERSE 1: DEZZY ( NERDS )

NERDS in this bitch
I'm different like 2 Chainz
Drivin' to get a mill but I ain't drivin' in the same lane
Girls on my phone but I don't even know her name
Can't never be alone cause my life is not the same
Hella faded with the boys, going stupid, makin' lots of noise
Bumpin' to some Pink Floyd
I'm about to Destroy all these fucking Decoys
Called rappers more like toys
Summertime is coming up man I'm ready
Time to get it my way, fuck her slow and steady
Living on the damn highway
You can call me hedley cause I'm gettin' head while I'm spittin' heavy
Dezzy's back again
I guess I'll call her quits
But I've been in this bitch since 1996
When I was still up in the womb
But Eastie's in this room so get up in this shit...

HOOK 1:
Uh, Uh...
Do you know what the fucking time is?
Uh, Uh...
It's Summertime BITCH!
Uh, Uh...

VERSE 2: EASTIE ( NERDS )
I'm a lyricly incline mastermind
Blow your mind with every line
Everytime I drop a line that sounded like it's summertime
And Time is money so you know I got a lot to spend
Now I´m rollin´ in a benz
Where´s the limit see no end
I´m looking like a masterpiece
Even when I´m in a suite: I'm rockin' Nikes on my feet
With a snapback, With the beak flat, Got the seat back, Got the beat cracked and my crew bad
Where my Nerds at? x2
Huh?
Yeah they're here with me
And oh I got your girl with me
And oh I got that weed with me
I guess I can say we've made it G
Feelin' here mentally, Even if it ain't physically
It's not a mystery, we're on the top and run the industry
Just a punk ass white kid with a tight flow and some nice kicks
So you know my talentshows
Got another kid here ready to go Time to hit 'm Maurice LET 'M KNOW!!

HOOK 2:
Uh, Uh...
Blowin' purple smoke out, it's like the sky's are grey
Uh, Uh...
Cause this is Summertime Days!
Uh, Uh...

VERSE 3: Maurice Van Meer
I'm Maurice; I've got my shades on
Music is my life; keep on going 'till we're ALL gone
No joke, I'm the best in my town
Performing like a clown
Now my voice is going Down...
YEAH!
I'm back again and well dressed again
I really can't wait for the summer
We'll do dumb shit or even dumber...
Swaggin' OH SWAG SWAG
Got Swag in my backpack
You're wearing a JETS hat
But I'm rocking snapbacks
Chillin' with my Vans on
Tweetin' really random
Girl you handsome
Let's ride on a hansom
Fuck school I'll be rappin'
Summertime's coming
And We'll make stacks man x2
SUMMERTIME 2013 LET'S GO!

HOOK 3:
Uh, Uh...
Nice weather, good weed, nothing's better
Uh, Uh...
I want this shit forever!
Uh, Uh...

VERSE 4: DV (MHR)
D O Double V
It is Summertime, Where I wanna be
Girls wanna come and get the D
Girls go: *Bloop*
When I hit the scene
Summertime lovin' is the best when you're just fuckin', huggin' and worrying about nothing
Like the fresh prince saying summer, summertime
Niggas just mad cause I rhyme
Call me cancer then, Cause I'm sicker than
If you thought you won, why you still trippin' then?
Niggas call me Vito, Cause I'm Guido
When I lay it in
You can bring a friend, Ain't nothing wrong with a little twinnie twin twin
OH you have a twin?
Hop up in my BENZ!
*Oh DV*
Let the records spin
We can get it in
You can tell your friends how I get it in
Lovin' Summertime is what I do, hop up in a pool
Have a drink with you, you know how I do only with you

LAST LIL' HOOK:
Uh, Uh...
I want this shit forever...
