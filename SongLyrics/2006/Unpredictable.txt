[Verse 1]
It is unpredictable
This life we live
Sometimes unbelievable
We can't comprehend

[Bridge]
It takes you up and down
And round and round
Here we go against the same thing everyday once again
Don't ever ever break away
Where there's a will oh there's a way

[Chorus]
It's not over
It's not over yet
Gotta hold on
Cause time will tell a tale

[Verse 2]
When doubt dominates your mind
You're in despair
Feeling like you're left behind
Like nobody cares


[Bridge + Chorus]


[Bridge]
It's not over
It's not over yet
It's not over yet
Don't ever break away (break away)
Where there's a will oh there's a way (there's a way)


[Chorus]
