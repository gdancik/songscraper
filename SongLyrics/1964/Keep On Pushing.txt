Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing
I've got to keep on pushing (mmm-hmm)
I can't stop now
Move up a little higher
Some way, somehow
Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Keep on pushin'

Now maybe some day
I'll reach that higher goal
I know that I can make it
With just a little bit of soul
Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

Now look-a look (look-a look)
A-look-a yonder
What's that I see
A great big stone wall
Stands there ahead of me
But I've got my pride
And I'll move on aside
And keep on pushin'

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Keep on pushin'
Keep on pushin'
What I say now keep on pushin'
[?] song now
