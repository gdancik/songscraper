Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Although you're never near, (I really need you.)
Your voice I often hear.  (I really need you.)
Another day, another night, (I really need you.)
I long to hold you tight, (I really need you.)
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Than weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Empty nights echo your name
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Will I ever be the same
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Oh yeah

(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know
(I need you and I want you, baby.)
Things have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Has all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
