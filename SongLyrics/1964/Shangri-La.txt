Your kisses take me to Shangri-La
Each kiss is magic
That makes my little world a Shangri-La
A land of bluebirds and fountains
And nothing to do
But cling to an angel that looks like you
And when you hold me, how warm you are
Be mine my darling
And spend your life with me in Shangri-la
For anywhere you are is Shangri-la
(Orchestral Break)
How warm you are
(Orchestral Break)
You make my little world a Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
