[Verse 1]
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'? You really wanna know?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now
But it seems like it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny, it's so funny how time slips away?

[Verse 2]
I wanna ask you a question is it alright?
How's your new love?
I want you to answer truthfully
Gee, I hope he's doin' fine
You know I heard something the other day
I heard ya told him
That you'd love him 'tll the end of time
Well, that's the same thing that you told me
It seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time just slip right on away?

[Verse 3]
I hate to leave you baby
But I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you somewhere 'round
But here's one thing you just can't tell
You don't know when, though
You never know when Joe Hinton will come back in town
But here's what I want you to do
Oh please remember what I told you
That in time, in time you're gonna pay
Ain't it funny, it's funny how time slips away
