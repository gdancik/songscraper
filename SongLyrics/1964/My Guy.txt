[Verse 1]
Nothing you can say can tear me away
From my guy
Nothing you could do, 'cause I'm stuck like glue
To my guy

[Verse 2]
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we stick together
I'm tellin' you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy

[Chorus]
Nothing you could do could make me be untrue
To my guy (My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie
To my guy (My guy)

[Verse 3]
I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful and I'm gonna
You'd best be believing
I won't be deceiving my guy

[Verse 4]
As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact

[Chorus]
No muscle bound man could take my hand
From my guy (My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place
Of my guy (My guy)

[Verse 5]
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy, we are
There's not a man today who can take me away
From my guy

[Chorus]
No muscle bound man could take my hand
From my guy (My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place
Of my guy (My guy)

[Verse 5]
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy, we are
There's not a man today who can take me away
From my guy (What'cha say?)

[Chorus]
There's not a man today who could take me away
From my guy (Tell me more!)
There's not a man today who could take me away
From my guy
