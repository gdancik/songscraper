Love me with all your heart
That's all I want love
Love me with all your heart
Or not at all...
Just promise me this
That you'll give me, all your kisses
Every Winter, every Summer, every Fall...
When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment, or an hour
Love me always, as you loved me
From the start..
With every beat of your heart...
Just promise me this
That you'll give me, all your kisses
Every Winter, every Summer, every Fall...
When we are far apart, or when your near me
Love me with all your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment, or an hour
Love me always, as you loved me
From the start....
With every beat of your heart !
