(B. Gaudio - B. Crewe)

Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

(Hand-me-down) When she was just a kid her clothes were hand-me-down
(Hand-me-down) They always laughed at her when she came into town
Called her rag doll, little rag doll
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace

Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

(Sad rag doll) I'd change her sad rags into glad rags if I could
(If I could) My folks won't let me 'cause they say that she's no good
She's a rag doll, such a rag doll
Though I love her so, I can't let her know

Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
I love you just the way you are

A-ahh, ah-ah-ah-ah ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
