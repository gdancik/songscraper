[Verse 1]
Put on your red dress, baby
Lord, we goin' out tonight
Put on your red dress, baby
Lord, we goin' out tonight
And-a bring some boxin' gloves
In case some fool might wanna fight

[Verse 2]
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
I'm pretty sure now baby
Don't you know you know you gonna knock 'em dead

[Instrumental Verse]

[Verse 3]
I got my Old Crow liquor
And my paycheck in my hand
I got my Old Crow liquor
I got my paycheck in my hand
Big John's bootleg whiskey
Cost much more than I can stand

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Know you're gonna be your [?]
I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead
