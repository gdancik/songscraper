[Chorus]
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

[Verse 1: Jermaine]
I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour, see

[Chorus: Jackson 5]
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

[Verse 2: Jermaine]
In our years together
We had stormy wearther
But our love has been so strong
But somehow we carry on, seeing

[Chorus: Jackson 5]
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

[Bridge: Jermaine + (Michael)]
You brought joy to my empty life, yeah
And all that's wrong, you made it right
My love (my love), I love (my love)
I love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jackson 5 + (Jermaine)]
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy (Oh how happy)
Oh how happy (Oh how happy)
Oh how happy you have made me
(You have made me) You have made
(You have made me) You have made
(Girl, you make me happy) You have made me
(Oh how happy) You have made me
(Girl, you make me happy...)
