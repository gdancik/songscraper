[Verse 1]
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear
I miss so much

[Verse 2]
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
From this whole world I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

[Bridge]
I need love now more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

[Verse 3]
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exists
And each time that darkness falls
It finds me alone with these four walls

[Outro]
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Without you, babe
Without you, babe
Without you, babe
Without you, babe
