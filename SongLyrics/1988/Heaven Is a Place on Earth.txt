[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

[Verse 1]
When the night falls down
I wait for you
And you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids
On the street outside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

[Verse 2]
When I feel alone
I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
(Heaven)
(Heaven)
(Heaven)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

(Heaven)

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
