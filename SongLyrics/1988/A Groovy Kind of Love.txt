[Verse 1]
When i'm feeling blue, all i have to do
Is take a look at you, then i'm not so blue
When you're close to me, i can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing near my ear

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love

[Verse 2]
Anytime you want to you can turn me onto
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When i kiss your lips, ooh i start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When i'm feeling blue, all i have to do
Is take a look at you, then i'm not so blue
When i'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, i don't care

[Outro]
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love, oh
We got a groovy kind of love
