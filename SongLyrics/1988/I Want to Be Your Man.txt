[Verse 1]
Joe works at the steel mill
Works damn near every day
Leaves for work when the sun comes up
Drops the kids at school along the way
(Kids at school along the way)

[Verse 2]
When the night is falling
He gets home and hugs his wife
He says how much he missed her
And that he loves her more than life, yeah

More than life

[Verse 3]
Joe may never be a rich man
No lawyer, or movie star
He may not own the finest jewelry
And he may not drive the nicest car
Joe has everything he dreamed of
All the treasures that he needs
No wonder Joe's always smiling
He only aims to please, yeah

[verse 4]
Let me be your Joe
I just want to love you
And watch our babies grow
I may not be no millionaire
But I want you to know
I want to be your Joe

[Verse 5]
You are just a woman and I am just a man
Though I may not feel every need
I hope you understand

[Verse 6]
I want to be your Joe
I want to be your Joe
Let me be your Joe
I just want to love you
And watch our babies grow
I may not be no millionaire
But I want you to know
I want to be your Joe
Let me be your Joe

[Verse 7]
I just want to love you
I just want to be your man
I just want to hold you
Love you with all that I am
I want to be your Joe
Let me be your Joe

[Outro]
I want to be your Joe
