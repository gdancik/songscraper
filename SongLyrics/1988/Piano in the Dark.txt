[Verse 1]
When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

[Chorus]
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

[Verse 2]
He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

[Chorus]
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

[Bridge]
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

[Chorus]
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

[Outro]
Oh..i cry,i cry..
