[Verse 1]
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

[Verse 2]
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

[Chorus]
I,I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

[Chorus]
I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

[Chorus]
I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

[Chorus]
You was standing
I was there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

[Chorus]
I was standing
You were there
