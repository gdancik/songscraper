[Verse 1]
I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

[Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

[Verse 2]
The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

[Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

[Bridge 1]
Love, love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No, I can't let you go

[Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

[Bridge 2]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

[Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

[Outro]
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name
