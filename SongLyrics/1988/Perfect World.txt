[Verse 1]
Talked to my dad on the phone today
He broke down and apologized
Said he sorry for the way things got fucked up
And he wished he did a better job
Couldn’t see his face but I could hear his watered eyes
I could hear him loud and clear; wonder what am I?
Understand me, I just want to see him try
But he didn’t want to see us, so he just shut his eyes
Told him don’t sweat it I’m good, I’m fine
Your childhood was no harder than mine
I know he’s your dad but motherfuck my grandpa and the daughters that he victimized
And the way that he treated his sons when your brother was alive
Once upon a time
And I know that you still don’t believe in the way that he died
Honestly neither do I but we just comply
Nod our head, move on
Brand new city, new wife, new mom
All those days you whooped my ass
Those same nights I wished you gone
So I hid in the bathroom and I wrote my first song without a beat
Hid the dirty clothes underneath the crack in the door
So you couldn’t ever see my feet
Let the water run so you couldn’t hear my voice
Hid the notebook so you never ever knew
Song after song, page after page, day after day
Writin' songs about you
So when you say that you proud of me now
Can’t explain what that means
We are who we are because of that shit
So no, I don’t want to be

[Chorus]
In a perfect world
Where nothin’ ever goes wrong
Far, far away from here, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow
In a perfect world
Where nothin’ ever goes wrong
Far, far away from here, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow

[Verse 2]
Talked to my big bro-bro today
He broke down and apologized
Said he’s sorry for the way things got fucked up
And he wish he did a better job
As he rolled up a blunt of some medical pine
Lit it, but he didn’t want to hit it this time
Hands started shakin' and then he started cryin'
Shit had been building in the pit of his mind
He said, "I wish I never robbed my brothers"
"I wish I never robbed those bitches"
Now any time somebody can’t find they shit
And they can’t find me, then I’m suspicious
Don’t nobody think I’m sufficient
And my time is ticking
I wish I never dropped out of school
Now it's either sell dope or wash them dishes
I said look my friend, my dawg
I know you feel lost and that’s real (true)
But you wouldn’t want to feel warmer inside if you never had gotten them chills (true)
Could you save your son from fallin’ this far if you don’t know how that shit feels?
If Anthony never OD'd and died then I would prolly still be poppin' pills
Rest his soul, we are who we are
You don’t enjoy thinkin' back that far
This shit wasn’t easy, most times it was hard
But the darkest of nights make the brightest of stars
So be the light in the dark, fuck bein' the norm
Some days I wish it was easier too, but shit we were not born

[Chorus]
In a perfect world
Where nothing ever goes wrong
Far, far away from me, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow
In a perfect world
Where nothing ever goes wrong
Far, far away from me, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow
In a perfect world
