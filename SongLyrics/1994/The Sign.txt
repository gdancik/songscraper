[Intro]
Whoa, oh, yeah

[Verse]
(Ah) I gotta new life
You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me
Ooh, is enough, enough?

[Chorus]
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong...
But where do you belong?

[Verse]
(Ah) Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Ooh is enough, enough?

[Chorus]
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong...
But where do you belong?

[Interlude]
Oh, oh oh!

[Larger instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind!
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, oh-oh-OH!
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

[Outro]
(I saw the sign - I saw the si-i-ign) I saw the sign!
(I saw the sign - I saw the si-ig-i-ign)
(I saw the sign - I saw the sign) i saw the sign!
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign!
