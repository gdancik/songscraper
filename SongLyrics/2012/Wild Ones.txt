[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it
Glass to the roof
That's how we does it, does it, does it
I don't care tonight
She don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Ooh-ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check one two-oooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break loose 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down: a hundred super models

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are were wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Ooh-ooh

[Bridge 1: Sia & (Flo Rida)]
I am a wild one; break me in (Yeah)
Saddle me up and lets begin (Yeah, yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (Now, now)
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl

[Bridge 2: Flo Rida with Sia]
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough
I can't lie
The wilds don't lie

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Ooh-ooh

[Outro: Sia]
I am a wild one; break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one; tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
