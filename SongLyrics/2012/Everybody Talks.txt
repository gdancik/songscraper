[Verse 1]
Hey baby won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you got to say
All you're giving me is fiction

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm a sorry sucker
And this happens all the time
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Verse 2]
Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itching

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh my, my shit
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks too much

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Bridge]
Never thought I'd live
To see the day
When everybody's words
Got in the way

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back

[Outro]
It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back
