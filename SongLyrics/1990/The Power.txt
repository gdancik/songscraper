[Intro]
Listen, spirit of Dot Rotten in 'ere, I don't even spit no more
Check this, yo

[Verse 1]
Motivated, I'm after a mil
I don't mean a big plate with food for a fat kid
I've been out of the game, but who's still established?
I'm introducing a madness
Fuck them crews that I used to collab with
Someone take a pic of my middle finger and @ them dons without using a caption
There's no future attachments
I'ma send shot after shot like I'm shooting a gatlin
Dress yourself in a suit
Don't try to pursue beef with me it's your doom if we're clashing
Burn your troops to the ashes
I'ma give 'em an aftershock like Bruiser and Bratt did
We were in the same boat, smooth sailing
I left it, sank, cause you're useless as captain
About crew of assassins
Stop all the gassing, fists, I'll put two in your chapped lips
I'll strike man like I'm using a matchstick
They try block me out, put dudes on a blacklist
Step back I refused and adapted
They want arms, I'ma give 'em more than they need like a mutant arachnid
I turn mute when I grab sticks, pull up on man like feds do to a group full of black kids
Bare man try and move to my girl, but I flew though like Alladin
Scooped me a Jasmine
I can see stress in their faces, hating, I love that human reaction
Here's the truth for the masses
Most of these rappers ain't shit without the use of an ad-lib
I feel disrespected for abuse of my practice
I make 'em snooze like a matress
Like yo
One, two
Want me to calm down? I don't want to
Say you got a gun? Well I got one too
Don't let me let off the gauge, one, two
If it's a fight, I'ma hit him with the
Left, right, combination one, two
Back him in beef, there ain't no one to
Anyone who warred with me never won cah
It ain't shit to get a donny got, blacked out like a golliwog
I make the dotty pop, the tip of the barrel of the shotty's hot
I body shit, hommy squad
I'm alight, smash the top of his head, molotov
Hitman, on the job
Difference, when I pitch him, everyone's gotta watch
I ain't talking 'bout casio, I'll slap the chrome
Leave a red circle on his top
A priest will bless you and your cotton socks
But back to road, I got a lot of spots
And these actors know I've got a lot of props
So don't act involved, I'm on shit like Snap Capone
None of these paigons want a shot
I'll click clack, blow
[?] and your head's gonna roll
Like, you feel the pressure, tension
You sneak diss and I'll be swift as I make you wish that you corrected your sentence
I'll walk in with a screw-faced expression assembling
Don't think 'bout protecting your bredrins
I'm destined to threaten a friendship
Got a problem? It's gettin' addressed till I mend it
Long knife to your right side tryna get your appendix
I leave dons distressed and offended
In one piece no adventurous penning
I hate seeing when a bad man dies I turned it off before it gets to the ending
They all say I'm a genius
My music's like a modern day Tesla invention
It's just death I'm presenting
Your girl wanna give me the sex it ain't tempting
Young boy better mind ya mouth
I'll come to Ladbroke Grove and fight you now
All the talk in the DM's, wait till I see him
Then it's Nick Cannon, I'm wild n out
I'll bust the cannon, light you down
I know you suck the salmon, you're kinda foul

[Verse 2]
Green with envy, you're snitching your team in the field so that makes you a snake in the grass
Fuck your rep, you ain't carrying weight, this ain't gym
You've never been raising a bar
I know bruddas with the drive that will get you merked for a benz, I don't mean your favourite car
Of course I'll Bernie Mac, cause you're a dead joke
You won't stand up, I'll dig your grave for a laugh
I get creative, if you're copying my style I'll draw you out for tracing my art
Animals beside me it's sink or swim, no I'll laugh at your boat while I sail in the arc
Leave you down for the count
No drac don't care if you bite necks
I leave a steak in your heart
I leave a memory of your face to the card
Wrap this bitch up like his saviour's allah
Didn't wanna believe in him
Even thought I was sent by god, I know who these atheists are
I'll make an example for the blud, thought it was love till you get soaked like taking a bath
You see me christen your boat by breaking your glass
Stabbed in grazed with the shards
You'll get mace to your face and I don't care what type of paigon you are
Aiming and blast
Have your peoples gather showing love to a box stop screaming
Think it's a rave in the park, you'll get set
I'm directing a casualty if you act up, I'll be arranging a [?]
The power's in the mind, I'm a mutant, I'll X men out
You would've thought it's a [?]
I'll boy them, when I come round make sure your behaviour is calm
No cape or the mask, I'll bat man
No funny bones in my body but I'll break you in half
With an oz, I've been on the roads G
See me on the streets with my goons you're evading the path
Badman pull up, thunder clap, you'll get left [?] like a Jamaican in dance
And there's hate in my glance it ain't gay when I say you're a little fuckboy, pain in the arse
Dressed to kill for real, I came in a suave all black like I'm raiding a yard
[?]
Doing this live but I bathe in the dark said he's the King lion I gave him a scar
