[Verse 1]
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

[Hook]
The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Verse 2]
Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

[Hook]
The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Bridge]
Every word of every song
That he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone
It happened so soon
What could you do?

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees

[Outro]
Black velvet if you please
If you please
If you please
If you please
