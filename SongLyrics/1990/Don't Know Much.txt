Yeah I’ve got some scars locked up inside
At night I curl up to them and hide
I feel the blood behind my face
It’s cold as hell, I’m cold as hell

You make a piss poor shadow of
A son, a man, a fighter
You make a piss poor shadow of
A wife, a friend, a lover

I keep my heart tied to a lie
I feel at rest when others cry
I know at best I’m just a 6…
But we’re pushing 12 when our fevers mix
I don’t much care what people say
I’ll find my death in my own way
I’ve done my time and I’ve had my share
And I’m bored as hell… I’m bored as hell

You make a piss poor shadow of
A son, a man, a fighter
You make a piss poor shadow of
A wife, a friend, a lover

Show me a sign, show me a sign
Show me the way down
I swear it’s real, cause to me it’s real
I found my pulse and it’s even keeled
This truth it leaks out from my mouth
Just know this love will last for always and always I’ll wait
Always and always, I'll wait
Always and always, I'll wait

I gave up chasing anything
It comes to me or it’s dead to me
I know more than I thought I knew
I feel at home in black and blue
Yeah I’ve got some scars locked up inside
At night I curl up to them and hide
I feel the blood behind my face
It’s cold as hell, and I’m cold as hell

This world is broke. Aren't I?
This world is broke. Aren't I?
This world is broke. Aren't I?

This world is broke and so are we
Show me a sign, show me a sign
Show me the way down
I swear it’s real, cause to me it’s real
I found my pulse and it’s even-keeled
This truth, it leaks out from my mouth
Just know this love will last for always and always I’ll wait
Always and always I'll wait
Always and always I'll wait
I swear it’s real, cause to me it’s real (x4)
