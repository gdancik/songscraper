[Intro]
Mmm
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-dee
La-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Whoa, the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now
Never sayin' what they mean

[Verse 2]
While they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
Whoa-ah

[Chorus]
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da da, da-dee
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play now

[Verse 3]
Whoa, we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame
Whoa-ah

[Verse 4]
But neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the things that might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
Whoa-ah

[Chorus]
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da da, da-dee
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play now

[Bridge]
Oh, yes
Oh, alright
Oh, yes
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 5]
Now look here
People walkin' up to you
Singin' glory hallelujah, ha-ha
And they try and to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord

[Verse 6]
They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope, cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate
Come on, get on board
Whoa-ah

[Chorus]
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da da, da-dee
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

[Verse 7]
Now, wait a minute
Look around tell me what you see?
What's happenin' to you and me?
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
Whoa-ah

[Verse 8]
'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn you back on humanity
Oh, and you don't give a
Da, da, da, da, da

[Chorus]
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da da, da-dee
I'll keep a-talkin' 'bout you and me, brother
And the games people play now, now

[Outro]
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da da, da-dee
Gonna talk 'bout you and me
Oh, and the games people play
I wonder can you come out and play?
Early in the mornin', whoa yes
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play now
