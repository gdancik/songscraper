{Intro}

These eyes
Cry every night, for you
These arms
Long to hold you, again

The hurtin's on me, yeah
But I will never be free
No, my baby, no no
You gave a promise to me, yeah
And you broke it
And you broke it, oh no

{Hook}

These eyes
Watched you bring my world to an end
This heart
Could not accept, and pretend

The hurtin's on me, yeah
But I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
When you spoke it
And you spoke it, babe

These eyes
Are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

Are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Cry every night, for you
These arms
Long to hold you
Hold you again

Are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
