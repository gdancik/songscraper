I got a gal and she's long and thin
Real nice condition for the shape she's in
Every time I see her, boy, I do a spin
Lean Jean, seventeen

She fell in a beauty shop to get away
The owner said, "I dig your wig but you need a shave"
And yet there's something 'bout her, makes me be her slave
Lean Jean, seventeen

I got a gal and she's long and thin
Real nice condition for the shape she's in
Every time I see her, boy, I do a spin
Lean Jean, seventeen

Jeannie baby's knock-kneed in her bobby socks
I'm so barrel-legged, when the rhythm rocks
When we stroll together we spell OX
Lean Jean, seventeen
