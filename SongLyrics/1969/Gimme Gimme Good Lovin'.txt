[Verse 1]
From Atlanta, Georgia
To the Gulf Stream water
Up to Califor-ni-ay
I'm gonna spend my life a-both a-night and day
And say

[Chorus]
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now
Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright
(Huh, huh-huh, huh, huh-huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2]
To the girl in 'Frisco
To the girls in New York
To the girls in Texarkan'
You gotta understand that baby I'm your man
And say

[Chorus]
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, now, now
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
(Huh, huh-huh, huh, huh-huh, huh, huh)

[Chorus]
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, now, child
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now

[Outro]
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
