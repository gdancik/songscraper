[Intro]
Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on, uh come on, give a listen

[Verse 1]
'Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels and throw dice
I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam

[Verse 2]
Ain't good lookin', but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look you girl, hey, in the eye
So if you need some lovin', and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

[Chorus]
But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to, got to ramble (ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin', gamblin' man

Yeah, uhh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hah
A bring it on, come on now
Yeah, alright, here we go now

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm out of money, 'cause you know I need some
Ain't gonna run on lovin', and I must run
Got to keep movin', never gonna slow down
You can have your funky world, see you 'round

[Chorus]
Cause I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
I got to ramble (ramblin' man)
Lord, I'm a ramblin', gamblin' man

Oh! I'm just a rambler
Yeah! and I'm just a gambler
Come on and sing along
'Cause I'm just a rambler (ramblin' man)
Lord I'm a gambler (gamblin' man)
I'm a rambler (ramblin' man)
