[Verse 1]
If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to his face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home?

[Verse 2]
If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets?

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home?

[Bridge]
Just trying to make his way home
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone
'cept for the Pope, maybe in Rome

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home
Just trying to make his way home, just like a holy rolling stone?
Back up to heaven all alone, just trying to make his way home

[Outro]
Nobody calling on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe in Rome
