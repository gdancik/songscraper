[Verse 1]
Hold on, little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

[Chorus]
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

[Verse 2]
Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up! Who cares about
Little boys that talk too much?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've seen it all go down
The game of love was all rained out
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

[Chorus]
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

[Bridge]
Why be alone when we can be together, baby?
You can make my life worth while
I can make you start to smile

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it's through, it's through
And fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

[Chorus]
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

[Coda]
Just to be the next to be with
You
