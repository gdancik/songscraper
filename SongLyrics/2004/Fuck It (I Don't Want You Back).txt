[Intro]
Whoa, ooh
Ooh-hooh
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
See, I don't know why I liked you so much
I gave you all of my trust
I told you, I loved you
Now that's all down the drain
You put me through pain
I wanna let you know how I feel

[Hook]
Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho, I don't want you back
Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho, I don't want you back

[Verse 2]
You thought you could keep this shit from me, yeah
Ya burnt bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head
Now you're askin' for me back
You're just another act
Look elsewhere, 'cause you're done with me

[Hook]
Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho, I don't want you back
Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho, I don't want you back

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah

[Verse 3]
You questioned, did I care?
You could ask anyone
I even said you were my great one
Now it's all over
But I do admit I'm sad
It hurts real bad
I can't sweat that, 'cause I loved a ho

[Hook]
Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho, I don't want you back

[Outro:]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (It don't mean shit now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (Might as well throw 'em out)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (They didn't mean jack)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (I don't want you back)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (It don't mean shit now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (Might as well throw 'em out)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-uh, yeah (They didn't mean jack)
