Ooh, ooh
All the time boy, need you all the time boy
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Oh, you started actin' like a boyfriend (boyfriend)
They think Imma treat you like a toy friend (uh huh, uh huh)
This ain’t makin’ no sense
How the hell did we end up with these emotions?

Damn it we awesome

They hate all the time
But let ‘em keep talking
Misery loves company
And all the girls want you
And all the boys want me

[Pre-Chorus]
Coz you got me doin' things that I wouldn’t ever do
Breakfast in the morning and I made it just for you, boo
Freaky deaky where you want I can do that too
(Do that too bitch)

[Chorus]
Coz this ain’t gonna be another song about a heartbreak, heartbreak, ooh ooh
(Heartbreak, I just wanna fall in love)
I was thinking later on if you could follow me to my place, my place, ooh ooh
(My place, I just wanna fall in love)
I don’t wanna hear another effin' song about a heartbreak, heartbreak, ooh ooh

Now you got a take you round the world friend (uh huh, uh huh)
