[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm fifteen for a moment
Caught in between ten and twenty
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

[Verse 2]
I'm twenty-two for a moment
And she feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars

[Chorus]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose,fif teen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live

[Verse 3]
I'm thirty-three for a moment
I'm still the man, but you see I'm a "they"
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind

[Verse 4]
I'm forty-five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life

[Chorus]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself
Within a morning star
Fifteen I'm all right with you, fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live

[Bridge]
Half time goes by, suddenly you’re wise
Another blink of an eye, sixty-seven is gone
The sun is getting high, we're moving on...

[Verse 5]
I'm 99 for a moment
And dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

[Chorus]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Twenty-two, I feel her too
Thirty-three, you’re on your way
Every day's a new day

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-who-ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh-who-ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh-who-ooh-who-who-who-who-who

[Chorus 3]
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose, hey fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live
