[Verse 1]
I would've given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I have
But if you want I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

[Verse 2]
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again (Try)
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know, oh

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

[Bridge]
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again
(Try to love again, try to love again)
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Ohh

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
When it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

[Outro]
Ohh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
Try to love again
