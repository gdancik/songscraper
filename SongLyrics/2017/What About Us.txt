It ain't no big deal that
I feel you are layin' him
I see you leanin' against the floor
It ain't nobody's business
Who you see or who you kiss
I feel you breathin' in the hall
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
Got an eye for an exit
And the ear that just begs to
I hear, does anybody here now think you're great
Forever, they ignore us
Not the guys that only bores us
Together we're gonna love everything that they hate
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
I don't care if she's right
Cross my heart, hope to die
Is it love?
They're gonna talk about us
They're gonna stare when we walk by
They're gonna talk about us
For the first time in our lives
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love
Is it love? Is it love?
Yeah

[MONICA]
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it

[JOEY]
Yeah right!
Serious?

[RACHEL]
Oh yeah, everything you need to know is in that first kiss

[MONICA]
Absolutely

[CHANDLER]
Yeah I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act - you know its like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out

[ROSS]
Yeah, yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's just that that's - that's not - why we bought the ticket

[CHANDLER]
You see the problem is though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again - you know, I mean we're in the car, fighting traffic, basically, just trying to stay awake

[RACHEL]
Yeah well, word of advice - bring back the comedian, otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone

[JOEY]
Are we still talking about sex?
