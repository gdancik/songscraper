[Hook:]
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh

[Verse 1:]
Honestly
If I tell--
Tell you what--
What you wanna know, love
There ain't another
Don't want no other lover
I'll put nothing above you
I'll kick 'em to the gutter
(Uh oooh)
They're trying to shake me
(Uh oooh)
They're c-calling me crazy now
(Uh oooh)
Look at us lately
(Uh oooh)
And tell 'em who's your lady

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs
You're here right now

[Chorus:]
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

[Hook:]
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh

[Verse 2:]
Now that you're loving back
We're happy, it's a fact
Can't nothing hold us back
We got this in the bag
(Uh oooh)
There ain't no maybes
(Uh oooh)
No question of your baby now
(Uh oooh)
Look at us lately
(Uh oooh)
And tell 'em who's your lady
I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs
You're here right now

[Chorus:]
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

[Outro:]
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
Uh oooh
