[Verse 1]
Don't lie, I know you been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time, and you wanna keep it in

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

[Chorus]
Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

[Verse 2]
Nine lives until you fall at my feet
Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, 'cause you'll end up losing it

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I'll feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

[Chorus]
Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

[Bridge]
So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
'Cause nobody wins these waiting games
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

[Chorus]
Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (Down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

[Outro]
Down, down
