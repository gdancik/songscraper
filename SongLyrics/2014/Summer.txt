[Verse]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now, but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

[Drop]

[Verse]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now, but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

[Drop]

[Bridge]
When I met you in the summer
Summer

[Drop]
