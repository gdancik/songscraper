I've waiting so long for school to be through
Paula, I can wait no more for you
My love, my love

If you love me true, if you love me still
Our love will always be real
My love, my love

True love means planning our life for two
Being together the whole day through
True love means waiting and hoping that soon
Wishes we made, will come true
My love, my love
