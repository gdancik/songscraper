[Intro]
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

[Verse 1]
Little Jackie Paper
Loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax
And other fancy stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

[Verse 2]
Together they would travel
On a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a look-out
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail

[Verse 3]
Noble kings and princes
Would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags
When Puff roared out his name

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

[Verse 4]
A dragon lives forever
But not so, little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings
Make way for other toys

[Verse 5]
One grey night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar

[Verse 6]
His head was bent in sorrow
Green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
Along the cherry lane

[Verse 7]
Without his lifelong friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon
Sadly slipped into his cave

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
