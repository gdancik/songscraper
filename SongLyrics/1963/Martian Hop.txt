We have just discovered an important note from space
The Martians plan to throw a dance for all the human race

Papa ohh mm Papa Papa ohh mir mir

Papa ohh mir mir

(eeeee-eeee-eeee-eee)

I got into my rocket ship to see the Martian Hop
I saw the place a shining red, so then I made my stop
But as I opened up the door and climbed the ladder down
I saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee

It seemed I was the first one there, and so I was surprised
To see the Martian twist and stomp before my very eyes
The did the Loco-Motion and the Hully Gully too
I couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee

Now right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun
The Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun
And so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground
And even though I'm back on earth I still can hear this sound

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
