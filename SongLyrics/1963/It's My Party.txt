[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Verse 2]
Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for awhile
'Til Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Verse 3]
Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Outro]
Oh, it's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Oh, it's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
