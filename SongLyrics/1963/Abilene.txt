Abilene Abilene prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene my Abilene

I sit alone most every night watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carryin' me back to Abilene my Abilene
Abilene Abilene...

Crowded city ain't nothing free nothing in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be in Abilene sweet Abilene
Abilene Abilene...
(Women there don't treat you mean) in Abilene my Abilene
