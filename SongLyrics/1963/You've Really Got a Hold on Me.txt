I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter
Tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me (please)
Hold me (squeeze)
Hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me (really got a hold on me)
I said you've really got a hold on me (I said you've really got a hold on me)
Ya know you've really got hold on me (really got a hold on me)
Ya know you've really got hold on me (really got a hold on me)
I said you've really got a hold on me (I said you've really hold on me)
