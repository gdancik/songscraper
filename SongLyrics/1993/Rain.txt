[Intro]
I feel it, it's coming

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 2]
When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

[Chorus 1]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Bridge]
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

[Spoken Interlude]


Waiting is the hardest thing
It's strange


I tell myself that if I believe in you
I feel like I've known you before


In the dream of you
And I want to understand you


With all my heart and all my soul
More and more and more


That by sheer force of will
When I'm with you


I will raise you from the ground
I feel like a magical child


And without a sound, you'll appear
Everything strange


And surrender to me, to love
Everything wild

[Bridge]
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

[Chorus 2]
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like

[Chorus 1]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Chorus 2]
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

[Outro]
I'll stand out on the mountain top
Until I hear you call
My name

Rain
