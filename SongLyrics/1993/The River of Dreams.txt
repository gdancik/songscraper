[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

[Verse 1]
And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out
What I've been looking for

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That I've been looking for

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

[Verse 3]
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

[Outro]
In the middle of the night
(Gloria, it's not Marie...)
