[Verse 1: Coko]
Boy there you go
You're tellin me that you love me
When will you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you

[Pre-Hook: Coko, Taj & Lee Lee]
You are so fine
You blow my mind
With the things you do to me
She sees she's not blind
To the things you do for me
But I know

[Hook]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[Verse 2: Coko]
Friends ask how could
I give myself to one who belongs to someone else
They just don't know
Your love's so good
That they would want for themselves

[Pre-Hook: Coko, Taj & Lee Lee]
You are so fine
You blow my mind
With the things you for to me
She sees she's not blind
To the things you do for me
But I know

[Hook]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[Segue]
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not
Ooh, what am I supposed to do

[Hook]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
