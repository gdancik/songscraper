[Intro: Jasmine & Aladdin]
How are you doing that?
It's a magic carpet
I-it's lovely...
You don't...you don't wanna go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world
Is it safe?
Sure, do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes...

[Verse 1: Aladdin]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Now tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "no"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine, (Aladdin)]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

[Verse 2: Jasmine]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Refrain 3: Jasmine, (Aladdin)]
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin with Jasmine, (Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin, Jasmine]
A whole new world
(A whole new world)
That's where we'll be
(That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
(A wondrous place)
For you and me
