[Verse 1]
Here they come again, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Catch us if you can, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Time to get a move on, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

[Chorus]
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can

[Verse 2]
Now we gotta run, (mmmm-mm-mm)
No more time for fun, (mmmm-mm-mm)
When we're gettin' angry, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

[Chorus]

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Here they come again, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Catch us if you can, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Time to get a move on, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

[Chorus]
