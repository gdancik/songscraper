[Verse 1]
I know a girl who's soft and sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

[Chorus]
I want Candy
I want Candy

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

[Verse 2]
Go to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

[Chorus]
I want Candy
I want Candy

[Refrain]
I want Candy
I want Candy
I want Candy

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

[Verse 3]
Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make her mine
Then I'll have Candy all the time

[Chorus]
I want Candy
I want Candy

[Outro]
Woooo
