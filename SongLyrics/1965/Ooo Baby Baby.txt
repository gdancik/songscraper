[Intro]
Ooh, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm cryin'

[Hook]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby

[Verse 2]
Mistakes I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm cryin'

[Hook]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby

[Verse 3]
I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I can't stop tryin'
I can't give up hope
Cause I'll be here
And on one day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
I'm cryin'

Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh, Ooh
Baby, baby
Oohoo
