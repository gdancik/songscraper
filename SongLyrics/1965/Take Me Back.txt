Becky Barnes
You look just the same
As I always remember
All those Friday nights
Under the lights
Under the bleachers together

You and I were meant to be
Something more than a faded memory
Till you and I, something divided us


If the universe is infinite
Then it’s definite
There’s an alternate reality
Where we're now a family

Take me back in time to love you
Take me back when we were lost
Lost in love and lost in feeling
Without the cost
Take me back in time to high school
Take me back when things were light
Light my heart and light my shadow
And make it alright

Cause I already lost it once
What I already won


[BECKY]
You don’t look the same at all
As I remember
The light has left your eyes
Something is changed
Then you were way more put together

But I remember something someone
Asked me back in school
Tom if you asked me
I'd still go to prom with you

The universe is infinite
And it’s definite
There’s an alternate reality
Where it’s only you and me. 

Take me back in time to love you
Hold me closer than before
Heal my heart and mend what's broken
To feel you once more


[TOM]
Without the cost

[BECKY (TOM)]
Take me back to high school (take me back to high school)
Take me back when things were light (take me back in time)


[BOTH]
Light my heart and light my shadow


[BECKY (TOM)]

One more night (One more night)


[BOTH]
Cause I already lost it once
What I already won
I've lost too much now
To care
But I know that something’s still there

[TOM]
I'll never let you go

[BECKY]
I'll never let you go

[BOTH]
I'll never let you go now

[JINGLE, JANGLE, KRIS AND NOEL]
Just take me back
Gotta take me back
Just take me back
Gotta take me back
Just take me back
Gotta take me back
Just take me back
Gotta take me back in time

Just take me back (oh)
Gotta take me back in (time)
Just take me back (oh)
Gotta take me back

[BECKY AND TOM]
In time to love you
Hold me closer than before
Heal my heart and mend what's broken

[BECKY (TOM)]
To feel you once more (feel you once more)
Take me back in time to high school (take me back to high school)
Take me back in time (take me back in time)

[BOTH]
Light my heart and light my shadow

[BECKY]
To make it alright

[TOM]
Make it alright

[BOTH]
Alright!
