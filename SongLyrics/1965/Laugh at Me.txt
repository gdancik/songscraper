[Chorus]
I'm sick of all this raiding
Well screw arena rating
But nothing compares
To pursueing all these honor kills
I'm done with all these dailies
And auction house trading
But nothing compares
To pursueing all these honor kills

[Verse 1: Decision]
Cool, guild downed archavon
With a couple of healers inside or gone
It's Mr. Deci with a heal up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like a murloc steez
I can't describe the gear I get
When I roll against 6 people
And damn I missed
Ah shit
The ret got it
Fuckin dick
Just look at spec real quick
These skills make me hallucinate
Then I grind till I own all the human fakes
So they ask holy DPS ? Whats happenin ?
Just another alliance kid tryna rap again
So crit, crit, c'mon crit
I said c'mon crit
Everybody in warsong just laugh a bit
No at xylan, dumbass, hes shit
We rock crits, better ask around
Always got Gigi to track u down
Gnomey, your team is loosin now
Just reroll horde or alt-f4 out

[Verse 2: Nyhm]
Screw HKs you know it's on
When I start killin kiddies down in gnomeregan
And your done when I run with Demineon
Waitin at the GY for when your ass respawn
Startin wars in southshore triggering alarms
Its like a nooby farm
Just havin fun, run son you've been outdone
And now Abandon got you locked with stun
"Silly Nyhm I bet you thought you won
But your gonna die when our mains log on"
Allies acting stupid
Hit his 55 mage in the face
With a few shadowbolt crits (eeeeeew)
Maybe i gank too much (uh huh)
But greys drop in one touch (uh huh)
Tanks, huntards, shamans and priests
Charge the GY he released!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Decision]
Hordey cousins
Lvl 80
Baby, yah
We grind all day
That's why the alliance
Hate us and they hate each other
Cuz we gonna take um to BG's
And we gonna own them
Crittin, crittin crittin crittin crittin, I dunno

[Verse 4: Gigi]
Top Kills
Kills I top
Top your kills
With dragonhawk
Wipe your crew and I'll be your mop
Thought it was amusing to make your e-peen flop
I wanna, shoot away
Like I'm in an arcade
And zombies keep coming like the underpaid
Feinding financial aid
Look for a bloke to smoke
No, oki dok
You pack up your head with hope
(cough)
Or is that ganja smoke?
Coming at me like that like real bad joke
Ahh, poor baby
Victim of my KB's
Now Frosty won't need a snack
(You're crazy!)

[Verse 5:Abandonation]
Did someone say ganja smoke?
Nah I'm joking pass me that gnome to choke
I'll show him the ropes and lure him with emotes
An HK earned this is murder that he wrote
I dual wield blades like dudes of Bushido
Your AFK I'll dot you with Hemo
Better call the paramedics I think you need cemo
"NATION WHY YOU DO THAT?"
You sound like Emo
Gut you like a fish and I don't mean Nemo
Maybe I do mean Nemo whatever ho
Am I really ODing off of honor kills?
Thank God I'll never think of poppin' pills

[Chorus]

[Verse 6:Demineon]
Caped in points
And still I kill
Honor points are just for thrills
I be critin, critin, critin, critin
Till it blur you're vision
No need for permission
I slice with pefect precision
I charge admmision for entering my battleground without consonance
I come from another dimension
My rhymes they will make you listen
So effcient offically make you pay attention to
What im about to do is
School you noob alliance kids
In the fundamentals of PvP

[Chorus]

[Verse 7:Decision]
Hordey cousins
Lvl 80
Baby, yah
We grind all day
That's why the alliance
Hate us and they hate each other
Cuz we gonna take um to BG's
And we gonna own them
Crittin, crittin crittin crittin crittin, I dunno, fuck it
