[Verse 1]
Well, I'd be doggone if I wouldn't work all day
And I'd be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Verse 2]
Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey hey hey! I'd be long gone
Oh I wouldn't be doggone, baby
I'd be long gone

[Bridge]
Now did you hear me?
Well now what I say, oh, believe me
Well, every woman should try to be
Whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you
Is for you to be true to me

[Verse 3]
I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Outro]
I wouldn't be doggone
Gone catch me a train
No baby, I wouldn't be
