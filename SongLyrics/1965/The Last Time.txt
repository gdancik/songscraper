[Verse 1]
Well I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

[Chorus]
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

[Chorus]
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

[Verse 3]
Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
Because I'll be gone a long, long time

[Chorus]
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no. Oh no

[Outro]
Maybe the last time

Last time, baby
Oh, no, no
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
