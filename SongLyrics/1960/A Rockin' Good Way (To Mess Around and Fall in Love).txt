If you're gonna give me
Good kissin' like that
Honey, don'tcha know
I'm gonna give 'em right back to you
That's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Ahh, that's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Now, that's a kissin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)
If you're gonna start out
By huggin' me tight
Don't mess around
Just a-hug me right
'Cause that's a huggin' good way
(That's a huggin' good way)
Brook, that's a huggin' good way
(That's a huggin' good way)
That's a huggin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)
You know you called me on the phone
And just because I was alone
Yes, you came around wooin'
Ahh, you'd better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin'
Now you kissed me
And you rocked my soul
And don't come around knockin'
Rock 'n' roll
'Cause that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
Yes, that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
That's a rockin' good way, ah ah, to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)
Well, you know you called me on the phone
And just because I was alone
You came around a-wooin'
You better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin'
Now that you've kissed me
And rocked my soul
Don't come around knockin'
Rock 'n' roll
That's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
Dinah, that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
That's a rockin' good way to mess around and fall in love
{It's a rockin' good way
And I love to rock, how 'bout you?
Ahh, baby, you got what it takes
Ah ha, ain't that somethin'?}
{You dig the run, I'll say
Cool, stay out of my spot
Oh yeah, alright, oh yeah
I like to spot though you know, alright
