[Verse 1]
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 2]
Going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 3]
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't going to do you no good at all
Because once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

[Verse 4]
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
