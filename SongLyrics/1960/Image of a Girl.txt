It's time for my weekly hair cut
I need to keep it long
Or I won't be the image of a girl
That sounds so wrong

I love your eyes, your hands are tiny, your cute
You're everything that I've dreamed about
I never seen such a beautiful girl, your adorable
With those looks you can become so loveable
And be adored by boys anyday, I think you're the light
At the end of my tunnel, I want to protect you
Even if I die, don't ask why, remember love is a mystery (yeah!)
I won't lost to anyone, I'll keep being number one in your heart
Girl if I ever cheat on you, then I was being such a retard

You look almost perfect, the only thing I can see that's wrong is your lips
They're not touching mine, neither are your hips, give me a kiss
Girl, after looking at you, I could gouge my eyes out
Are you from Tennesee? because you're the only ten I see
You're under arrest for stealing my heart and you're guilty for being too sexy
Let go and let me set you free, I'll never let you go, even if you ask me to
In my eyes, you are like the sun, so warm and so cute, without you I may die (yeah!)
Everything you do makes me want to kiss you, say thank you since I'm a gentleman
I'll never touch you without your permission, but watch out maybe I'll do you some surprise
You roar at me like Katy is gonna love me unconditionally
I thought happiness started with a h, why does mine start with a u?
Does your left eye hurt, because you've been looking right all day
Did you invent the airplane? cause you seem Wright for me
If you were a booger I'd pick you first
Girl if I ever cheat on you, then I was being such a retard

Hello I'm a thief and I'm here to steal your heart
I bet you $20 you're gonna turn me down
Would you please grab my arm? so I can tell my friends
I've been touched by an angel
If a thousand painters worked for a thousand years
They could not create a work of art as beautiful as
You
