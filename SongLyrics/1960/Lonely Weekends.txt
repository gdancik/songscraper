[Chorus]
Well I make it alright (Well I make it alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends

[Verse]
Since you left me (Since you left me)
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd be (Ooh-wah) good to me (Ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (Ooh-wah) would never die (Ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (Ooh-wah) good to me (Ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try

[Chorus]
Well I make it alright (Well I make it alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd be (Ooh-wah) good to me (Ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (Ooh-wah) would never die (Ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (Ooh-wah) good to me (Ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try

[Chorus]
Well I make it alright (Well I make it alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
