My darling, I love you so
More than you'll ever know
Each night I kneel and say a prayer
Hoping when I wake you'll still be there

I need your love with all my heart
Promise me we'll never part
We have a love that's sure to be
True love for all eternity
Always remember my love is true

No matter what I may do
And stay in this heart of mine
Until the very end of time
My dearest, I beg of you
To keep this love so plain and true

I ask the Lord, Lord up above
To never take away our love
No matter what I may do
Remember my love is true
We have a love that's sure to be
True love for all eternity
