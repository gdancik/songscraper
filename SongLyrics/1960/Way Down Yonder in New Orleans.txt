Well, way down yonder in New Orleans
In the land of the dreamy scenes
Ah, there's a Garden of Eden
Ah, you know what I mean

Yeah, Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper with tender sighs
And then you stop
Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

Yeah, there is Heaven right here on earth
Ah, with those beautiful queens
Yeah, way down yonder in New Orleans
Whoa

Way down yonder in New Orleans, whoa
In the land of the dreamy scenes
Ah, there's a Garden of Eden
Ah, you know what I mean

Well, Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper with tender sighs
And then you stop
Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

Yeah, there is Heaven right here on earth
Ah, with those beautiful queens
Well, way down yonder in New Orleans, yeah
Whoa
