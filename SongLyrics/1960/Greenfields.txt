Once there were greenfields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above
Once they were part of an everlasting love
We were the lovers
Who strolled through greenfields

Greenfields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day
(Oh) I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world
Left for me to see

But I'll keep on waiting
Till you return
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on a roam
You can't be happy until you bring it home
Home to the greenfields and me once again
