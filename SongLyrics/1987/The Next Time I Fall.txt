(Verse 1)
[PETER CETERA]
Love, like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand

[AMY GRANT]
Darling, I put my heart up on a shelf
Til the moment was right, and I told myself

(Chorus)
[PETER CETERA]
The next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
The next time I fall in love
Oooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

(Verse 2)
[AMY GRANT]
Now, as I look into you eyes
Well, I wonder if it's wise
To hold you like I've wanted to before

[PETER CETERA]
Tonight, I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine

(Chorus)
Next time I fall in love
I know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Oooh
Next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love

[AMY GRANT]
It will be with you

(Bridge)
[PETER CETERA]
Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try

(Chorus)
Next time I fall in love
I know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Oooh
Next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

(Repeat and fade)
Next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
