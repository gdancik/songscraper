[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine, gon' tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm tellin' you on how I feel
Gon' hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
I'm givin' you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm tellin' you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doin' wrong
Gon' lock you up before too long
Your lyin' eyes gon' tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Organ Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face?

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, you know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad

You know it (Really, really bad)
You know it, you know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
You know, shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I move, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
Shamone, You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad
You know, woo! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
