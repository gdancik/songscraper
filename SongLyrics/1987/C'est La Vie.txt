[Verse 1:]
Got a job
That's O.K
But they've got me
Working night and day

Punching in
Punching out
Is this really what life's all about?

[Pre-Chorus:]
What'cha gonna do?
What'cha gonna feel?
I don't know

What'cha gonna feel?
What'cha gonna do?
Ooh
Won't someone tell me

What'cha wanna say?
What'cha wanna do?
There's only one thing left to say
What'cha wanna say?
What'cha wanna say?
Ooh

[Chorus:]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)

[Verse 2:]
Baby's gone
All alone
Are you sad
Because you're on your own?

Get that girl
Party down
There's so many good ones still around

[Pre-Chorus:]
What'cha gonna do?
What'cha gonna feel?
I don't know

What'cha gonna feel?
What'cha gonna do?
Ooh
Won't someone tell me

What'cha wanna say?
What'cha wanna do?
There's only one thing left to say
What'cha wanna say?
What'cha wanna say?
Ooh


[Chorus:]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)

[Bridge:]

Hey J.J
What you been doing?
You say your car broke down
The thing just isn't moving

J.J.J
Don't you know?
When you're down
There's just one way to go
Now sing it

[Chorus x4:]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
