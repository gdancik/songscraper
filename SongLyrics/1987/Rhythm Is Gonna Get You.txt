[GLORIA]
At night, when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get you

(Cheers from the crowd and dancers.)

[EMILIO, spoken]
Hey, so you remember when I told you that after we met with the President and did the show, we could take the bus straight up to Syracuse?

[GLORIA, spoken]
Oh God, what?

[EMILIO, spoken]
Yeah, we can't take the bus the bus straight up to Syracuse--

[GLORIA, spoken]
Emilio!

[EMILIO, spoken]
We just got invited to a private dinner for Sony. 

[GLORIA, spoken]
No! When?

[EMILIO, spoken]
Tomorrow night. We head to New York right after the show. 

[GLORIA, spoken]
Look, it's my one night off and I'm exhausted. I can't even-- just tell them we can't go. 

[EMILIO, spoken]
Baby, listen. It's too big, we have to at least make an appearance. 

[GLORIA, spoken]
You're gonna make me go?

[STAGE MANAGER, spoken]
Gloria?

[EMILIO, spoken]
I'm gonna make you go. 

[GLORIA, spoken]
I hate you. 

[EMILIO, spoken]
I know. 

[GLORIA, spoken]
I love you!

[EMILIO, spoken]
I know. 

[MALE DANCERS]
Oh ay oh ay!
 
Oh ay oh oh ah!
 
Oh ay oh ay!
 
Oh ay oh oh ah!
 
[FEMALE DANCERS]
 
Oh ay oh ay!
 
Oh ay oh oh ah!
 
Oh ay oh ay!
 
Oh ay oh oh ah!
(Cheers from audience and dancers.)

[GLORIA, spoken]
Are you ready to party? ¿Dónde está mi gente?

[JOSÉ, spoken]
Gloria Maria, you're playing and singing so beautifully, your voice brings joy to a place even as dark as Vietnam. You're a born artist, my angel, and one day you're going to be a big star! Tell your sister that I love her, okay? And tonight before you go to bed, you give your Mommy a big kiss for me!
