[Verse 1: Marvin]
Every day there's something new (oooh baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (oooooh honey)
And with every passing minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Bridge: Tammi]
And I, I've got a song to sing (ooooh, love)
Telling the world about the joy you bring (Oooooh, sweet love)
And you gave me a reason for living (Ooooh, honey)
And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of giving

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Verse 2: Marvin and Tammi]
To find a love like ours is rare these days
Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return (oooooh, baby)
Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn (Ooooh, love)
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation (Ooooh, sweetheart)
Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

[Chorus: Both]
Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
