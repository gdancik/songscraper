[Verse 1]
Here he comes now
I've got to tell him somehow
I could put it off 'til later
But it's best I do it now

[Verse 2]
Baby, listen to me
There is something I must try to say
I've put it off so long
But I've decided that today is the day

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My love for you is dyin'
Oh, no, please don't start cryin'

[Chorus 1]
I take it back, I didn't mean it
Please forget the things I said
I take it back, I'm sorry
I must have been out of my head

[Verse 3]
He's such a man
It must have hurt him a lot if he let me see him cry
But I must try again
This time I'll say goodbye

[Verse 4]
Baby, you've been good to me
You've always been the best you could
So try and understand me now
The way you've always understood

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't go on another day
Oh please, don't look at me that way

[Chorus 2]
I take it back, I didn't mean it
Please forget what I just I said
I take it back, I'm sorry
I must have been out of my head

[Outro]
Sometimes it's better to be loved
Than it is love
