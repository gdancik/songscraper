My father looked at me one day, said Son, it's plain to see
That you're getting older and should have a talk with me
You'll soon be going on lots of dates as to a man you grow
And there's one important thing every boy should know
And that is
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why some have eyes of blue
That's why some stand five foot two
Cause girls, girls, girls were made to love
One day soon you'll have a date and you'll take her home that night
Then you'll find you'll wonder Would a kiss be right?
The more you look, the more you'll find those doubts will fill your head
But think real hard and you might recall what your old Dad said
He said that
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why ya watch em walk down the street
That's why their kisses taste awful sweet
Cause girls, girls, girls were made to love
Then you'll meet that special girl wholl sweep your offa your feet
You'll want to say you love her but you'll find it hard to speak
This is a time when you'll find it's better left unsaid
Just tell er like I've told your Mom, with a kiss instead
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why ya watch em walk down the street
That's why their kisses taste awful sweet
Cause girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
