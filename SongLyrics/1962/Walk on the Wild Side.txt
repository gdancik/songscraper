Holly came from Miami F.L.A
Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A

Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her leg and then he was a she

She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, 'Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side '

Candy came from out on the island
In the back room she was everybody's darling

But she never lost her head
Even when she was given head

She says, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls go
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay

A hustle here and a hustle there
New York city is the place where

They said, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
I Said, 'Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side

Sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat

Went to the Apollo
You should have seen him go go go

They said, 'Hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side
I said, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
All right, huh

Jackie is just speedin' away
Thought she was James Dean for a day

Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that dash

She said, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
I said, 'Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls say
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
