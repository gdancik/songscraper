Oh lord, I say

Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
She take all me money
And she move to Las Vegas

One more time

Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
She take all me money
And she move to Las Vegas

I thought of all the friends I lost
The woman even stole my housing
Costs
Matilda done take all me money
And I run to Las Vegas
Where the money was to pay for my
House and land
Then she dropped a serious
Plan
That's Matilda she take all me
Money and I run to Las Vegas

That woman she ain't no good
She take all me money
Never thought she would
My friends all told me what she would do
She'll steal from me and she'll steal from you

Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
She take all me money
And she move to Las Vegas
Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
She take all me money
And she move to Las Vegas
Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
She take all me money
And she move to Las Vegas

Where the money was right inside me bed
Looked up in the matress just below me head
That's Matilda she done take all me money and I run to Las Vegas
A fellow shout, be shoutin' at me head
He said hey boy come on in inside your bed
That's matilda she done found your money
And I run to Las Vegas

Bring it all back to me
Bring it all back to me
Bring it all back to me

She take all me money and I move to Las Vegas
Matilda, Matilda, Matilda

She take all me money
And I move to Las Vegas
