(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)

I wanna tell all you people
I dropped a penny in the well
Hoping you would come back soon
I couldn't believe what I heard

A fortune teller told me
My love with you was doomed
I hope her reading was wrong
I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long, come home

Hey, gong gong gong, yeah

(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)

I can't sleep at night for thinking of you
Every night about two
My love for you comes tumblin' down
I can't stand being here alone

I start a feelin' and a fumblin'
But you ain't nowhere around
I hope her reading was wrong
I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long, come home

Hey, gong gong gong, yeah

(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Hey, gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)

(I'm blue do be, do be, do be do)
Gong gong gong, yeah
