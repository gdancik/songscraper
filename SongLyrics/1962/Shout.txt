I still remember
When you used to be nine years old
Hey, hey

I was a fool for you
From the bottom of my soul
Hey, hey

Now that she's older
You're old enough to know
Hey, hey

You want to leave
You want to let me go
Hey, hey

I want you to know
Girl, I want you to know right now
You've been good to me, baby
Better than I've been to myself, hey, hey

And if you ever leave me
I don't want nobody else, hey, hey
I said I want you to know
Girl, I want you to know right now

You know you make me wanna, come on now
(Shout, shout)
Come on now, come on now

Come on now, come on now
(Shout, shout)
Feel alright now, come on now

All us shout now, come on now
(Shout, shout)
Come on now, hear me shout
(Shout, shout)

Hear me shout now, come on and shout
(Shout, shout)
Hear me shout now
