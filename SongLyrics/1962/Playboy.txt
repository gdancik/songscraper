Watch out
Oh girls, you know we've got to
Watch out
Girls, you know we've got to

Watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out
Here comes that playboy

Playboy
Get away from my door
I heard about the lovers you had before
You took their love for a game of joy
And tossed their hearts around
As though it was a toy, playboy

Well, playboy
Find yourself some other toy
Cause this is one heart you won't destroy
Cause I can't stand for what you're putting down
Fooling around with every girl in town, playboy

Well, you ain't saying nothing in my book
'Cause this is one fish you'll never ever hook
You left the others standing with their hearts in pain
And now you're coming 'round tryin' to do me the same

So playboy
I've seen your kind
Winning every girl with that same old line
So playboy
Stay away from my door
I know about the lovers you had before
Playboy

Whoa, you know you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy
Yes, you know you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy

Oh, you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy
You better watch out
You better watch out

Well, you ain't saying nothing in my book
'Cause this is one fish you'll never ever hook
You left the others standing with their hearts in pain
And now you're coming round trying to do me the same

So playboy
I've seen your kind
Winning every girl with that same old line
So playboy
Stay away from my door
I know about the lovers you had before
Playboy

Whoa, you know you better watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch for the playboy
He's bringing you false joy

Watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out
Here comes that playboy
