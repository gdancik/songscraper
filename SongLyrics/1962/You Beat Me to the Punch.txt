[Verse 1]
That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name

[Chorus 1]
You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

[Verse 2]
After I had known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours

[Chorus 1]
You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

[Verse 3]
Since I love you, I thought you would be true and love me tender
So I let my heart surrender -- to you, yes, I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me -- blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day

[Chorus 2]
And beat you to the punch this time
And beat you to the punch this time
I'll beat you to the punch, yes, I will
And let you know, know, how it feels
