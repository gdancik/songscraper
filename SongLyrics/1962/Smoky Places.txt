Meeting in smokey places, hiding in shadowy corners
Dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smokey places

Oh, oh, how I cried on your wedding day
Like, like my heart would break
How you regret your wedding day
Now paying for your bad mistake

Meeting in smokey places, hiding in shadowy corners
Oh we are dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smokey places

Some sunny day he will set you free
Free to be my life, some sunny day
Sweetheart, he'll set you free
We'll be, we'll be satisfied

Meeting in smokey places, hiding in shadowy corners
We just keep dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smokey places
Sharing love stolen in the night in smokey places
Sharing love stolen in the night in smokey places
