If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out the danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out the danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I sing about the danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Well I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
