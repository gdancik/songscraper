Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone away
Thrill is gone baby
Thrill is gone away
Know you done me wrong
You'll be sorry some day
Thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
Thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
Oh I'll still live on baby
But so lonely I'll be
Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone for good
Oh the thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Some day I know I'll be open baby
Like I know I should
I'm free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Free, free, free, now baby
Baby I'm free from your spell
Now that its all over
All I can do is wish you well
Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone away for good
Thrill is gone baby
Thrill is gone away for good
Know you done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry some day
The thrill is gone
I'm free from your spell......
