[Verse 1]
Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside

[Chorus 1]
I'm so happy
That you love me
Life is lovely
When you're near me
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile

[Verse 2]
Living life is just a game, so they say
All the games we used to play fade away
We may now enjoy the dreams we shared so long ago

[Chorus 2]
Oh my darling
Got to have you
Feel the magic
When I hold you
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky

[Brass Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
Now I need you
More than ever
No more crying
We're together
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
