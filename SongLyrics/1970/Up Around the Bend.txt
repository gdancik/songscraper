[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Ooooh!

[Verse 2]
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Ooooh!

[Verse 3]
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!

[Guitar solo]
Ooooh!

[Verse 4]
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!
