{Intro}

{Verse 1}
You've got to change your evil ways, baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change, baby
And every word that I say is true

{Chorus 1}
You got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby
Baby

{Verse 2}
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who

{Chorus 2}
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change

{Bridge}

{Verse 2}
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who

{Chorus 3}
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, yeh yeh yeh

{Outro}
