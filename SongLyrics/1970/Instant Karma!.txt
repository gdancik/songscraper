[Intro]
Three, four...

[Verse 1]
Instant Karma's going to get you
Going to knock you right on the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're going to be dead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love?
What on earth you tryin' to do?
It's up to you, yeah you!

[Verse 2]
Instant Karma's gonna get you
Going to look you right in the face
Better get yourself together, darling
Join the human race

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How in the world you gonna see
Laughing at fools like me?
Who on earth d'you think you are?
A superstar? Well right you are!

[Chorus]
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Every one, come on

[Verse 3]
Instant Karma's going to get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Every one you meet

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear?
Why on earth are you there when you're everywhere?
Come and get your share!

[Chorus]
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Come on and on and on, on, on

Yeah, yeah, alright
Ah, haa, aaaahh

[Outro]
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
On and on and on, on and on
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
