[Intro]
Ekip, ekip, ekip
MMS, LDO, NRM, 667, LZ
667, 669
Corleone, Ashe
20-20 Phantom Menace
Bitch
Baw
Huh
Ekip, ekip, ekip

[Verse 1: Freeze Corleone]
I only believe in God, I invoke no demons (Never), when I'll die, insha'Allah I'll rise up (Han)
On the production, Freeze Corleone, New York city style as MaxThaDemon (Ekip)
I'm here for the cash, taking the dough, I stash it, failing equals bashing
Nigga, you better talk microns for the hash, Faygo for the flash, I see the sockets, I dash, bitch (Sku, sku)
D.G.A.F to be in the head trio (Han), opposition are as heavy as ten bytes (Uh)
FN SCAR, Walther, everyday, fuck BioTech
Chen Zen aka Thanos (Han), S/o the ch'nord, S/o Kamoss (Ekip)
I burn more gas than a whip, in the field like Sergio Ramos (Sku)
Thraxx and 'milla, I stink that loud when I'm in the stores
Brown dry hash like wookiees, no construction if I say we got the tools (Sku, sku)
Rolling off a big hash cigarette (Bitch)
Your flow isn't even worth six reefers (Bitch, bitch)

[Bridge: Freeze Corleone]
Performing in every field (Han, han)
Corleone, Ashe, bitch, you know us (Ekip, ekip, ekip, ekip)
Performing in every field (Baw, baw)
Corleone, Ashe, bitch, you know us, ekip (Sku)

[Verse 2: Ashe 22]
Drill, all rappers wanna pop in (Brr), my racks are one foot long
On the field, bitch, I'm on attack mode, go ahead, send me a shot (Brr, brr)
LZ, the specimens, we'll see where life takes us, bitch
In the swamp, I walk around, bitch, gonna smoke 'em, promise you, bitch
I come up on the beat, chilling, and way back then I'd have sold L to the Beatles (Brr)
I'm in the kitchen, passing around the joint to my friends in the pitch
We're not gonna have a fight, I'm going to slap your mom and tear apart your sweatshirt (Bitch)
I'm only smoking dry and expensive weed, I'm in the 8th
All the bitches love when we lurk around in a car
2+3 = 5, it's simple, bitch, I'm not going to draw it, bitch
You wanna give me head, come down (Brr)
I'm in the slums of Lyon, she wants some, I make her moan (Brr)
I don't drink milky coffee (Grr), my bros supporting me, bitch
The beat I raped it, yeah (Wow), yeah, I'm in the streets but I'm still making purple banknotes
Bitch, don't be surprised (Bitch), if we reach the top quickly (Wow)
I'm wearing the bracelet right now and shit I make it ring, I spend my life lurking around (Brr, brr, brr)

[Outro: Ashe 22]
Ashe, Corleone, bitch, bitch
