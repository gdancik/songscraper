[Intro: Backing Vocalists]
Ohhh, ohhhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2: Kids]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Instrumental Outro]
