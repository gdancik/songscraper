[Verse 1]
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I wanna help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I say

[Verse 2]
You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
And if you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, yeah

[Verse 3]
You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We can make it, stick with me

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
For you and me

[Bridge]
Coming up, coming up

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up, I say
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Feel it in my bones

[Verse 4]
You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around, we're nearly there

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, for all to share
Coming up, yeah
Coming up any way
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
