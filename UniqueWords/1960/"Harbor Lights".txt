But
more
shore
to
your
from
lights
How
just
all
on
were
heart
The
help
is
Goodbye
told
once
same
my
near
I
Now
other
we
Will
could
tender
know
whispering
brought
the
long
you
saw
That
steal
And
kiss
starting
tears
if
They
nights
love
ship
hold
Beside
Some
lonely
me
parting
watched
harbor
only
sea
while
old
For
was
silvery
