still
glowin
standing
dark
to
Your
your
hear
Galveston
She
Before
waves
in
winds
While
water
dream
Standing
used
is
gun
left
my
her
lookin
oh
dry
eyes
I
we
beach
where
there
twenty-one
for
birds
see
the
watch
waiting
And
she
clean
crashing
out
am
afraid
tears
On
flashing
crying
run
flying
me
cannons
At
sun
When
by
of
sea
so
blowin
's
was
dying
