to
last
You
were
had
room
used
eyes
head
And
as
feel
night
empty
they
'm
reached
when
was
that
Came
dawn
The
my
I
tasted
lips
image
Then
too
the
filled
out
eagerness
comfort
way
me
shadow
Last
Oh
Your
much
gone
golden
and
dream
hand
ready
hair
gentle
could
you
be
kiss
love
raised
bear
face
your
from
light
with
bed
real
staggered
perfume
for
through
touched
racing
not
came
Too
fell
lonely
upon
so
