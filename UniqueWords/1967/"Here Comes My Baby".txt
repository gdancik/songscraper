never
'll
forever
In
to
names
that
do
But
a
walking
with
You
on
time
here
no
and
now
guy
alone
And-a
Never
my
talking
oh
matter
I
With
walk
phone
shame
becomes
this
Here
moonlight
comes
surprise
try
seeing
the
long
midnight
you
fine
be
And
she
as
keep
out
're
love
call
another
lonely
mine
Walking
me
how
baby
mile
of
every
picture
so
Well
's
it
