to
How
You
time
finally
now
used
go
Wait
want
doorways
Mirage
kissing
live
telling
we
Here
know
see
are
Hard
And
second
hallways
Where
that
coming
in
alleys
The
remembering
is
everything
back
my
Just
oh
I
touch
without
imagination
too
the
keep
Saturday
but
about
run
doorway
have
me
by
every
again
Oh
place
view
strong
much
gone
all
yeah
and
side
Now
mirage
comes
something
you
That
be
into
love
it
But
standing
face
So
your
a
walking
like
movies
vanish
through
eat
're
how
car
really
only
so
's
