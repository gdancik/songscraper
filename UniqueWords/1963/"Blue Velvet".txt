But
'll
May
still
stars
velvet
a
gone
She
light
Precious
in
were
heart
ours
and
than
Blue
can
left
Like
my
her
held
warm
eyes
I
rapture
flame
sighs
Feeling
Warmer
burning
tender
there
brightly
through
see
blue
the
Softer
she
be
And
glow
grow
tears
love
night
satin
From
Bluer
always
Ours
when
ooh
of
memory
years
tightly
was
Love
wore
