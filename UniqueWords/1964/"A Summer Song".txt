day
we
say
Beats
end
know
Soft
their
And
good
when
Laughing
against
pane
swayin
To
that
do
Sweet
lights
in
breeze
no
Autumn
Just
my
I
sky
Trees
the

Showin
They
nights
kisses
me
Wish
have
goodbye
at
by
again
'll
away
all
and
dream
starry
fall
must
walked
you
think
warmth
days
things
of
it
But
In
cares
a
No
leaves
As
n't
our
distant
hurts
Gazing
sleepy
window
some
so
's
did
summer
