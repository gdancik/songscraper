ca
You
forgot
Life
instead
go
day
each
head
say
cries
sleep
seems
see
went
And
feel
night
empty
breaks
million
cry
when
do
man
free
The
help
down
my
pillow
I
My
right
the
set
They
me
by
every
away
gone
heart
and
should
Now
keeps
hour
could
you
think
Every
hold
myself
of
memory
Wishing
It
it
never
But
your
a
holds
passing
can
n't
minute
where
broke
lay
tears
're
a-hurtin
tight
Since
lonely
so
since
