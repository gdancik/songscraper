In
to
that
a
was
flowers
all
gone
completely
gave
heart
fades
were
The
and
wide
had
saved
inside
my
di
opens
walk
I
fog
distant
where
la
seems
evening
for
lifetime
Then
wondered
are
the
you
far
sunshine
And
as
kiss
means
died
're
love
knew
drifted
There
mine
have
me
above
Where
turns
When
very
star
around
of
Al
lovely
lifted
it
bloom
smile
gloom
