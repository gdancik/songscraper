'll
he
to
your
will
How
just
in
on
sunny
free
like
heart
no
break
Sharing
life
cried
Like
my
smokey
bad
oh
I
Now
paying
our
day
we
where
for
dancing
hiding
wedding
Oh
stolen
the
faces
shadowy
you
are
one
would
mistake
set
be
keep
Meeting
love
night
satisfied
Some
corners
Free
how
places
Sweetheart
regret
some
We
knows
Dancing
