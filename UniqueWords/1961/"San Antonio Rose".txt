Deep
he
stars
to
that
your
dreams
a
was
all
in
with
like
heart
Moon
sweet
alone
and
song
Call
strange
once
back
my
within
broken
melody
I
petals
live
splendor
San
Antone
falling
lies
there
tender
words
apart
known
know
beside
blue
the
Enchantments
would
A
And
as
pass
own
Broken
Beneath
love
empty
up
moonlit
Lips
hears
Where
above
Still
again
found
by
of
memory
only
rose
old
Well
so
Speak
For
it
Alamo
