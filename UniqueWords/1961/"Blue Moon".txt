standing
to
adore
a
will
just
suddenly
in
You
Please
heart
Moon
The
alone
no
had
dream
Blue
appeared
turned
heard
gold
my
Without
oh
I
Now
there
for
could
ever
the
longer
saw
somebody
And
one
care
own
arms
love
hold
knew
moon
before
me
Someone
saying
'm
when
really
of
prayer
then
only
looked
what
was
whisper
