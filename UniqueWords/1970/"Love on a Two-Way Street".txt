to
die
How
on
were
time
finally
now
told
softly
held
With
know
loved
And
as
blind
cry
then
his
desperation
was
thought
Love
To
will
in
is
my
I
lips
pain
the
music
out
but
way
two
fooled
me
goodbye
found
He
've
and
Honey
been
highway
must
walked
could
you
be
love
crying
very
first
name
bear
It
it
never
hurting
he
True
a
lost
playing
gently
shame
for
blame
revelation
up
lonely
saying
Is
give
street
so
's
while
laughs
